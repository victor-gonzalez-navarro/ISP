        "txt": "PASSIONATE MINDS: Women Rewriting the World, by Claudia Roth Pierpont. (Vintage, $13.) These brief profiles of women writers like Gertrude Stein, Ayn Rand, Eudora Welty and Doris Lessing, all originally published in The New Yorker, are unified by their subjects' intense need to transcend the limitations of their own lives through language and storytelling. The book is an ''adroit melding of biography and criticism'' that ' isparkles with intelligence, wit and human interest,'' Morris Dickstein wrote in the Book Review last year. EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, by Zo Heller. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.) Willy Muller is a reptilian celebrity biographer, misanthrope and all-round scuzzy character haunted by the ghost of his estranged daughter, who before her suicide mailed him every journal she would written since she was 9. Writing here last year, Jeff Giles called this ''an acerbic, sneakily touching novel'' that at its best ''calls to mind Martin Amis is phosphorescently nasty oeuvre.'' DARWIN'S WORMS, by Adam Phillips. (Basic Books, $13.) A noted British child psychotherapist reflects on Darwin is lifelong interest in earthworms and Freud is fascination with death, both of which offer cause for celebration in a world abandoned by God. ''Almost invariably lively and entertaining,'' Phillips is essays ''are directed as well toward instructing their audience,'' Steve Marcus said in these pages in 2000. WINSTON AND CLEMENTINE: The Personal Letters of the Churchills. Edited by Mary Soames. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $16.) Winston Churchill and his wife, Clementine, were devoted pen pals throughout 57 years of marriage, as this huge volume edited by their daughter attests. His ' amanly, buoyant style is displayed to great effect,'' Thomas Mallon wrote here in 1999, while ''Clementine . . . can bring Nancy Mitford to mind.'' Churchill Wanted Dead or Alive, by Celia Sandys (Carroll & Graf, $14), is a colorful account of the young Churchill is experiences as a newspaper correspondent in the Boer War, including his escape from a prisoner of war camp. The ''fascinating narrative,'' as put together by his granddaughter, ' amay be the romantic stuff of Victorian adventure fiction, but it has the virtue of being true,'' David Murray wrote here in 2000. AFRICAN FOLKTALES: Traditional Stories of the Black World. Selected and retold by Roger Abrahams. (Pantheon, $18.) An accomplished Africanist plumbs the oral tradition of tribal families throughout the sub-Sahara in this revised anthology of earthy and comedic tales of magic, sultans, ghosts, lovers and animals that behave like people. ''The result is a rousing good read,'' Jason Berry said in the Book Review in 1983. A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER, by David Liss. (Ballantine, $14.) This engaging first novel revolves around a mixed bag of 18th-century characters at the time of the South Sea Bubble, the first stock market crash in the English-speaking world. ''What makes 'A Conspiracy of Paper' so readable is that Liss manages to create a number of arresting side plots featuring everything from the London underworld to boxing to social mores to English anti-Semitism,'' James Polk wrote in these pages last year. THE BLIND SIDE OF THE HEART, by Michael White. (Cliff Street/HarperCollins, $13.) The narrator of this unconventional whodunit is Maggie Quinn, a blunt-spoken housekeeper who wrestles with drink and doubt when her employer, a Roman Catholic priest who once rescued her sanity, is indicted for the murder of an altar boy they both loved. In 1999 our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, admired ' nothe cruel beauty'' of White is ' ispare, unflinching prose.'' MORMON AMERICA: The Power and the Promise, by Richard Ostling and Joan Ostling. (HarperSanFrancisco, $17.) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, founded by an itinerant treasure hunter from upstate New York in 1830, has a global membership of more than 10 million. This primer, which sorts through the doctrines and practices of the Mormon faith, ''is eminently fair, well researched and exhaustive,'' Timothy Egan wrote here last year. THE MAGIC KINGDOM, by Stanley Elkin. (Dalkey Archive, $12.95.) In this crazy quilt of a novel, a man mourning the loss of his 12-year-old son leads a group of terminally ill children on a trip from England to Disney World. ''Part sick joke, part lyrical meditation on the nature of disease,'' the comic tale ''is both hysterical and profound,'' Max Apple said here in 1985. Scott Veale",

In just its first month of operation the service, by the company is estimate, has sold three million songs online, at 99 cents each. This is an impressive figure considering the limited access that music fans now have to the service.

That complication came this week when the specter of the music industry, which has been publicly supportive of iTunes, began to loom over Apple.

Apparently trying to stay in the record industry is good graces, iTunes removed a service it had previously offered customers. Called Rendezvous, the service enabled listeners and their friends to access one another is music and listen to it -- but not download it -- from any computers. Hackers, however, had figured out how to download the music as well, creating programs with names like iLeach and iSlurp.

I can import the CD is into my iTunes music software and create MP3 files of the readings, but I do not see any way to bookmark a file when I stop listening to it in my iPod. Does the iPod offer a bookmark function? A. The iPod, Apple is portable player for digital music files, has a built-in bookmark function that can hold your place in an audio book, but the feature works only with files in the Audible format. Audible files, which have a file extension of .aa, include audio books, radio programs and other spoken-word content and are available at www.audible.com. The Audible bookmark feature does not typically work with MP3 files, including those you make yourself from audio book CD is. But if you press the iPod is pause button and allow the device to go into sleep mode, it will usually resume playing the audio file at the point where you left off. This is not a wholly reliable feature because buttons can be pushed accidentally, and switching between songs or connecting the iPod to a computer will cause it to lose your place in an audio book. Another way to return to your place in an audio file is to note the time code displayed on the iPod is screen when you press Stop. When you resume listening, the recording will begin to play from the beginning. Press the round Select button in the middle of the iPod is scroll wheel, then rotate the wheel to advance quickly through the file to return to the time you noted. Pressing the iPod is Next/Fast Forward button while a file is playing will also enable you to advance it quickly through a song or audio book. Audible.com has a large collection of content to download at a variety of prices. Audible files mesh well with Apple is iTunes music program for Macintosh and can also be used with the new Windows iPod with the latest iPod software and Audible is AudibleManager software (www.audible.com/software). Is there a place on the Web that offers free downloads of electronic books in the public domain? A. More than 6,200 complete electronic books are available for downloading from the library of Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.net). The collection includes Shakespeare is plays, ''Frankenstein'' by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, a selection of Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and thousands of other literary works. Most of the books and electronic texts available from Project Gutenberg date from before 1923, so their copyrights have expired. They come in the form of plain text files that are usually compressed in the Zip format for faster downloading. Once you download a book, you can read it on a computer in any text-editing or word-processing program, print it out or transfer it to a personal organizer or other device that can display text files. Project Gutenberg accepts donations of money and time from volunteers who are willing to type in or proofread additions to the collection. Microsoft Word has the largest share of the word processing market over all, but not within the legal profession, where Corel is WordPerfect is the leader. What features make WordPerfect more attractive to lawyers and their staffs? A. Several factors are probably involved. WordPerfect became a standard program in many law offices back in the days of DOS, and Corel produces a version geared specifically to the needs of legal word-processing. Although Word pulled ahead of WordPerfect in terms of market share as the Windows operating system took hold in the 1990 is, some lawyers find that WordPerfect handles footnotes and endnotes far more reliably. WordPerfect is Reveal Codes feature, which allows you to see precisely how text is formatted, also has many devotees. A Web site called WordPerfect vs. Word (www.wpvsword.com) devotes itself to meticulous comparison of the features of each program is latest version. J.D.BIERSDORFER",

Its producer, Jon Brion, has said that Ms. Apple is label, Sony Music is Epic Records, shelved the album because it did not hear potential hit singles. An Epic spokeswoman said, ''Fiona has not yet delivered her next album.'' Lately, what purports to be the full album, 11 songs, has been leaked onto the Internet, where -- despite the efforts of Sony is legal department -- a simple search will find multiple sources of downloads. The album is an oddball gem. Its producer, Mr. Brion, is fond of instruments that huff and plink and wheeze, as he showed in his soundtrack for ''I [heart] Huckabees.'' Epic may have been discomfited that Ms. Apple is collaboration with him does not sound anything like what is on the radio now. As a songwriter, she is the same Fiona Apple who sold millions of copies of her first two albums; she is still sultry and sullen, obsessing in detail over why her romances went wrong and teetering between regret and revenge. Her vocals smolder like torch songs, then boil over with rage and accusations. But this time, the music does not always mope with her. The album sets the 21st century aside. The beats are often waltzes and oom-pahs, not hiphop or punk; the arrangements are full of cellos, horns, bells and vintage keyboards. Ms. Apple is piano and voice are still at the center of the music, but now orchestras and show bands sprout around her, adding layers of whimsy and artifice. Ms. Apple has always placed herself somewhere between confession and entertainment, but in songs like ''Window'' or ''Better Version of Me,'' the carnival bounces and mock-Hollywood glitz put a cartoonish frame around her traumas, giving them a brand-new perspective. Had it been released, ''Extraordinary Machine'' would have been a fine counterbalance to a pop moment full of monolithic, self-righteous sincerity. As it stands, mysteriously leaked and proliferating, the album is an object lesson in how an Internet that is not controlled by copyright holders can set artistic expression free. JON PARELES",

Is it best to leave it plugged into a power source at home, or to leave it unplugged so it can discharge and then recharge it as necessary? A. Apple does not recommend leaving the PowerBook plugged in all the time with its lithium-ion battery connected because the internal chemistry can stagnate, which may shorten battery life. Unplugging the laptop and working from the battery once a month or so helps to discharge the stored energy and gets those electrons moving. The company also recommends that you calibrate your laptop is battery every few months. Laptop batteries contain microprocessors that tell the computer how much of a charge is left, but they can get out of sync. This causes the computer to give incorrect information about the charge status. Calibration helps the battery and computer communicate more accurately.",

But in six years between albums, Ms. Apple, 28, has grown into a wry self-consciousness. Her romances are still a shambles, and she painstakingly splits the blame between her lovers and herself. Yet there is a new layer of perspective on her magnificent third album, ''Extraordinary Machine'' (Epic/Clean Slate). ''I think he let me down when he did not disappoint me,'' she admits in ''Get Him Back.'' As she plunges into her latest miseries, her music finds something droll in the cycle of love and betrayal. She does it with anachronism. Her music looks back as far as the 1920 is and 30 is, with her piano giving the songs a music-hall bounce, while her lyrics are unmistakably modern: confessional, self-doubting, occasionally awkward and determinedly personal. ''My method is uncertain/It is a mess, but it is working,'' she sings in ''Please Please Please,'' which could be a reproach to a music business that urges, ''Give us something familiar.''",

And so, the video iPod. And with it, Mr. Jobs is particularly clever coup: sealing a deal with his quasi-estranged partner, the Walt Disney Company, to distribute downloaded versions of such hit Disney-produced shows as ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost'' on the new gizmo, at $1.99 each. It is not exactly 500 channels of entertainment, but it is a good anchor tenant, supplemented by pay-per-download music videos and other clever features, such as films from Mr. Jobs' other outpost, the animation studio Pixar.",

        "txt": "On Fiona Apple is new album, ''Extraordinary Machine,'' her ''Better Version of Me'' trumpets a personality upgrade. But every incarnation of this 28-year-old singer-songwriter has been fascinating, from the ferocious teenage provocateur of her 1996 debut, ''Tidal,'' to the fragile poet-warrior of the 1999 follow-up album, ''When the Pawn,'' to the current muscular songwriter whose work is so structurally sound it is hard to imagine that production indecision held up its release for years. At her packed show at the Nokia Theater in Midtown on Sunday, when Ms. Apple admitted ambivalence about being onstage, a devotee admonished, ''It is where you belong, honey!'' But in the years after the disappointing sales of ''When the Pawn,'' Ms. Apple has confessed to being happier sitting in her yard carving pine cones with razor blades. Resistance to fame, evidenced most famously by her petulant outburst at 1997 is MTV Awards, has always endeared her to fans. But they also want her to make music, lobbying for the release of the delayed new record after a scrapped version, made with Jon Brion as producer, leaked online last year.",

        "txt": "1. Fiona Apple: 'Extraordinary Machine' (Epic). Take 2 of this long-awaited, prematurely leaked album is the keeper. On the finished album, a little bit of Jon Brion is surreal cabaret orchestration brackets the newer stripped-down, focused versions of the songs. Ms. Apple continues her obsessive self-examination and convoluted thoughts of betrayal and regret, but now adds something: enough distance for some wry perspective. 2. M.I.A.: 'Arular' (Interscope). The means are modest: singsong choruses that could be playground chants, sparse tracks made with sounds from cheap synthesizers and drum machines. But the ambitions of M.I.A., a refugee from the civil war in Sri Lanka who went to art school in London, are huge and largely fulfilled on ''Arular,'' her debut album. The raps glance at violence, displacement, lust and determination in tracks that are irresistibly, incessantly danceable. 3. Shakira: 'Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1' (Epic). This is pop 2005: catchy songs about love found and (even better) lost that casually toss together reggaet\u00f3n, bossa nova, Colombian cumbia, chanson and half a dozen varieties of rock, for starters. It all suits a voice that can be insouciant, sultry or desperately impassioned, and a songwriter whose globe-hopping comes naturally. 4. Sufjan Steves: 'Illinois' (Asthmatic Kitty). Songs about significant events and characters in Illinois -- the second of the 50 states Mr. Steves plans to write albums about -- are at once grandly orchestrated, homespun and emotionally resonant. With his large supporting cast, Mr. Steves finds ways to take history personally. 5. The Frames: 'Burn the Maps' (Anti-). If Radiohead had a love life but stayed just as bleak, it would sound like the Frames on this album of heartsick, craggy, majestic rock songs that never trade drama for melodrama. 6. Bright Eyes: 'Digital Ash in a Digital Urn' (Saddle Creek). Conor Oberst, a k a Bright Eyes, released two albums simultaneously in 2005: the folk-rocking ''I am Wide Awake, It is Morning'' and the far more electronic ''Digital Ash in a Digital Urn.'' Both are among the year is best albums. Yet where ''Wide Awake'' simply adds to Mr. Oberst is stockpile of brilliantly observed songs about personal matters like ambition and casual sex, ''Digital Ash'' uses its ricocheting, disembodied sounds to contemplate time, war, death and the meaning of life. 7. Bettye LaVette: 'I have Got My Own Hell to Raise' (Anti-). It seems all too conceptual to have a 59-year-old soul-music trouper sing a collection of songs by women. But Ms. LaVette is flinty voice and lean, bluesy, cannily arranged band tear into every song, turning old wounds into tokens of survival. 8. Stephen Malkmus: 'Face the Truth' (Matador). Three albums after the breakup of Pavement, his definitive 1990 is indie-rock band, Stephen Malkmus remains waywardly alternative. His lyrics fling aper\u00e7us at life, art and commerce, while his tunes melt down the old verse-chorus-verse, deploy banjos and wobbly synthesizers, amble off on jam-band tangents, plunge into garage-rock or do the acoustic tango. He is as smart as he is mercurial. 9. Konono No. 1: 'Congotronics' (Crammed Discs). Take traditional, polyrhythmic thumb-piano trance music from Congo, plinking away in dizzying syncopated patterns. To crank it up for big outdoor parties, run it through buzzy pickups and amplifiers made from, among other things, scavenged car parts. The result is electric Minimalism that is exuberant and relentless, changing from percolating to hypnotic to a tingle that reaches deep into the nervous system. 10. Sleater-Kinney: 'The Woods' (Sub Pop). Distortion is everywhere on ''The Woods,'' Sleater-Kinney is seventh album, and it brings a nervy intensity to songs already worked up. With just two guitars, drums and Corin Tucker is banshee wail, Sleater-Kinney can sound as immense as a metal band and as bristling and unkempt as their indie-rock beginnings. Singing about love and war, truth and spectacle, the trio still plays as if everything were at stake. Top Songs: Bruce Springsteen: ''Devils & Dust'' Amerie: ''1 Thing'' Irma Thomas: ''Back Water Blues'' Miranda Lambert: ''Kerosene'' Kanye West: ''Gold Digger''",

The changes to the nickel have little to do with technology but may upset purists just the same. In the 97 years that presidents have been stamped on coins, never has one been shown in anything other than profile. Purists had better get used to the new look, however: no further changes to the nickel are in the works. CHANGING SCENERY The News -- Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk who shot Pope John Paul II in St. Peter is Square in 1981, was released from prison in Istanbul. Behind the News -- The release was strongly criticized by Turkey is justice minister, who said it offended the ''public conscience'' and ordered a review. Mr. Agca, 48, had been convicted not only of shooting the pope but of killing a Turkish journalist. He will remain free while the appeal is heard. But he is also obligated to fulfill his mandatory military service, which he missed while in prison. CHANGE OF HEART The News -- The skier Bode Miller apologized for statements he made that suggested he had raced while under the influence of alcohol. Behind the News -- Miller, the best all-around skier the United States has ever produced, had been under pressure from American and international ski officials to apologize after his remarks on ''60 Minutes.'' While he apologized, he neither admitted nor denied that he had raced after drinking, and he spoke for little more than two minutes without taking questions. All of which should add to his reputation as an iconoclastic free spirit as he heads to the Olympics next month.",

        "txt": "They were bundled up in candy-apple red outside the Madison Avenue offices of Sony BMG Music Entertainment one frigid morning in early 2005, petitioning for the release of a new album by their idol: ''We want Fiona! We want Fiona!'' It had been five years since the last record by Fiona Apple, above, and fans were engaging in panicked speculation about the hold-up: Had a new album been rejected by her label? Was Ms. Apple too much of a perfectionist to let it go? Whatever the reason, ''Extraordinary Machine'' (Epic), released in October, was well worth the wait. In songs with thick, jazzy textures and playful orchestral arrangements, Ms. Apple studied the failure of relationships through a lens of blame and regret, sometimes punching angrily at her piano and sometimes flitting through an anachronistic falsetto fantasy. Through it all, she sang as if she were at an exquisitely painful -- and revealing -- couples' therapy session. (''I think he let me down when he did not disappoint me.'') If Ms. Apple is anguished flagellations were what her fans risked frostbite to demand, they got more than enough. On her first major tour since the album is release, she plays with Damien Rice, a singer-songwriter who surrounds his breathy music with florid strings and even more florid self-pity.

With its announcement on Monday, Rhapsody, a joint venture by RealNetworks and MTV Networks, became the latest digital music service to do away with digital rights management, or D.R.M., which prevents users from making unauthorized copies of songs and can also determine which electronic devices can be used to listen to the songs. Apple has used D.R.M. since it began selling music on iTunes five years ago \u2014 and offers song previews at 30 seconds \u2014 but the other major download services, Amazon.com, Napster, Wal-Mart and eMusic, all sell music without restrictions. Rhapsody will restrict full-song previews to 25 a month, and the company also announced that users of Verizon can listen to songs from Rhapsody through their cellphones.",

But can it help you to imagine that you are Captain America, brandishing your shield and fists against the ruthless Red Skull? Yes, it can do that, too. On Friday, Marvel Comics, the publishing home of heroes like Spider-Man and the X-Men, said it was introducing a free application for the iPad that will give readers access to a digital library of more than 500 comics from its 70-year history. The software program, Marvel Comics App, developed by the digital comics distributor comiXology, offers free access to the first issues of titles like New Avengers and The Invincible Iron Man. Other recent and vintage issues can be downloaded for $1.99 each. Marvel says it sees the app as being complementary to the experience of buying and reading physical comics, not supplanting it. \u201cThat Wednesday, when people go to the stores, I call it a mini Comic-Con,\u201d Ira Rubenstein, the executive vice president of Marvel is global digital media group, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt is where fans gather and talk about the books and they argue about the books and speculate about the books.
