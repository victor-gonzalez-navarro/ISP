At the rate he is going, Mr. DeLay will steal the show from President Bush -- in ways the Republicans may regret. His plan to have a children's charity help underwrite the expenses for convention galas and provide a tax-free spot for major donors to deposit their cash is controversial enough. But having some of the G.O.P.'s best and richest walk a gangplank to and from the city each day has just the hint of xenophobia that already finds Democrats dancing in the streets. The Republicans made much of their decision to hold the convention in Democrat-heavy New York, in no small part as a gesture toward the city's perseverance after 9/11. Mayor Michael Bloomberg welcomed the custom for the city's hotels, restaurants and nightspots. But Mr. DeLay's former chief of staff has been lobbying for the mass embarkation to the Norwegian Dawn, a 15-deck, 14-bar, 10-restaurant ship offering ultrapriced rooms and what Mr. DeLay's office deems ''good security'' for up to 2,200 passengers.

Less than 1 percent of the country's home computers are Macintoshes that are compatible with the iTunes Music Store, and only a fraction of those have a broadband connection to the Internet.    But it would not be an online success story without a complicating twist. That complication came this week when the specter of the music industry, which has been publicly supportive of iTunes, began to loom over Apple. The success of iTunes, after all, depends on cooperation from the music business, which controls the songs that iTunes wants in its collection. Apparently trying to stay in the record industry's good graces, iTunes removed a service it had previously offered customers. Called Rendezvous, the service enabled listeners and their friends to access one another's music and listen to it -- but not download it -- from any computers. Hackers, however, had figured out how to download the music as well, creating programs with names like iLeach and iSlurp. So on Tuesday Apple sent out an update for its iTunes software, disabling Rendezvous and limiting music access to a user's local network at home or at work.

Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., said it planned to gather customer feedback from the site in the next few months, make changes, and ''officially launch the service'' next spring. The service, called Music Downloads, is available at www.walmart.com. Competitors, including iTunes and Napster, offer song downloads for 99 cents. The move mimics Wal-Mart's entry into the business of renting DVD's by mail, when it cut prices to draw customers away from rivals like Netflix. Wal-Mart is seeking a foothold in online music as downloading is blamed for the declining sales of CD's. Global music sales fell 11 percent, to $12.7 billion, in the first half of this year, after declining 7 percent last year and 6 percent in 2001, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group. Shares of Wal-Mart rose 70 cents, to $52.60. The market for legally downloaded music will be $35 million this year, a fraction of annual music sales, said David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Research, a technology research firm.

Remixed from the original multitrack session tapes, these performances have a warmth and fullness that makes the sound on the original album seem flat and squashed. The most notable difference, and the one that occasioned the remix in the first place, is that the lush choirs and orchestrations that Phil Spector larded onto the songs ''Let It Be,'' ''The Long and Winding Road'' and ''Across the Universe'' have been shorn away, leaving the unadorned performances that the band originally meant to release.

I can import the CD's into my iTunes music software and create MP3 files of the readings, but I don't see any way to bookmark a file when I stop listening to it in my iPod. Does the iPod offer a bookmark function?", "abstract": " Q. I enjoy books on CD's and would like to listen to them on my iPod. I can import the CD's into my iTunes music software and create MP3 files of the readings, but I don't see any way to bookmark a file when I stop listening to it in my iPod. Does the iPod offer a bookmark function?    A. The iPod, Apple Computer's portable player for digital music files, has a built-in bookmark function that can hold your place in an audio book, but the feature works only with files in the Audible format.      Audible files, which have a file extension of .aa, include audio books, radio programs and other spoken-word content and are available at www.audible.com.      The Audible bookmark feature does not typically work with MP3 files, including those you make yourself from audio book CD's.     But if you press the iPod's pause button and allow the device to go into sleep mode, it will usually resume playing the audio file at the point where you left off. This is not a wholly reliable feature because buttons can be pushed accidentally, and switching between songs or connecting the iPod to a computer will cause it to lose your place in an audio book.      Another way to return to your place in an audio file is to note the time code displayed on the iPod's screen when you press Stop. When you resume listening, the recording will begin to play from the beginning. Press the round Select button in the middle of the iPod's scroll wheel, then rotate the wheel to advance quickly through the file to return to the time you noted. Pressing the iPod's Next/Fast Forward button while a file is playing will also enable you to advance it quickly through a song or audio book.     Audible.com has a large collection of content to download at a variety of prices.      Audible files mesh well with Apple's iTunes music program for Macintosh and can also be used with the new Windows iPod with the latest iPod software and Audible's AudibleManager software (www.audible.com/software).    Q. Is there a place on the Web that offers free downloads of electronic books in the public domain?    A. More than 6,200 complete electronic books are available for downloading from the library of Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.net). The collection includes Shakespeare's plays, ''Frankenstein'' by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, a selection of Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and thousands of other literary works.     Most of the books and electronic texts available from Project Gutenberg date from before 1923, so their copyrights have expired. They come in the form of plain text files that are usually compressed in the Zip format for faster downloading.      Once you download a book, you can read it on a computer in any text-editing or word-processing program, print it out or transfer it to a personal organizer or other device that can display text files.     Project Gutenberg accepts donations of money and time from volunteers who are willing to type in or proofread additions to the collection.    Q. Microsoft Word has the largest share of the word processing market over all, but not within the legal profession, where Corel's WordPerfect is the leader. What features make WordPerfect more attractive to lawyers and their staffs?    A. Several factors are probably involved. WordPerfect became a standard program in many law offices back in the days of DOS, and Corel produces a version geared specifically to the needs of legal word-processing.      Although Word pulled ahead of WordPerfect in terms of market share as the Windows operating system took hold in the 1990's, some lawyers find that WordPerfect handles footnotes and endnotes far more reliably.     WordPerfect's Reveal Codes feature, which allows you to see precisely how text is formatted, also has many devotees.      A Web site called WordPerfect vs. Word (www.wpvsword.com) devotes itself to meticulous comparison of the features of each program's latest version.

It is a pleasure to recommend fothergilla, a shrub far less well known than it ought to be, possibly because its common name is witch alder (it is related to witch hazel). In midspring, fothergilla has sweet-smelling white bottlebrush-shape flowers on the ends of the branches, abundant enough for you to say ''cloud of bloom'' without blushing.

An Intel spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that computers not using Intel's wireless module would be unable to use its new Centrino brand name, which Intel has committed $300 million to advertise and cooperatively market. Centrino includes the Pentium-M, the wireless module and a set of support chips. A Dell spokesman declined to comment on its marketing relationship with Intel.

The Latitude D series, which Dell is expected to announce today, will include Intel's Pentium-M processor, which is also expected to be released today. An Intel spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that computers not using Intel's wireless module would be unable to use its new Centrino brand name, which Intel has committed $300 million to advertise and cooperatively market. Centrino includes the Pentium-M, the wireless module and a set of support chips. A Dell spokesman declined to comment on its marketing relationship with Intel. Intel and Broadcom's wireless modules both work with the industry standard Wi-Fi or 802.11b networking, which transmits data over unlicensed radio spectrum at 11 megabits a second. Broadcom's chips also use a preliminary version of a faster, 54-megabit-a-second update called 802.11g. An engineering group plans to finish 802.11g by June, but several consumer hardware companies, including Linksys and Apple, began shipping Broadcom-based 802.11g equipment in December and January.

Other Italian businesses may have closed and Piccolo's may be the last tiny business venture on a block now full of multistory buildings, but this neighborhood grill has hummed along nearly 50 years. Its cheese steaks are so well known that there has been talk of renaming it Piccolo's Cheese Steaks. Sure, other things are on the menu, like Italian soups, pasta and specials of meatloaf and fried fish on Fridays. But something about Piccolo's combination of bread, meat and cheese -- amid much Frank Sinatra lore -- keeps generations of customers coming back. The cheese steak sandwich ($6.50) doesn't look like much, served without garnish on a plain white plate. The chewy bread comes from a local Italian bakery, the cheese is American, and the meat, in a thicker slice than usual, is the real deal. No Steak-Umms here; the rib steak is boned and cut by hand by Piccolo's founder, Joseph Spaccavento, and his son, Pat, better known as Patty, who runs the daily operations. Toppings include raw or saut\u00e9ed onions, hot peppers and ketchup or mustard depending on personal preference. Is there a right way to eat it? ''Whatever you enjoy is the right way,'' Patty said. Even if there were a wrong way, Patty wouldn't tell you. After all, he is in the business of pleasing people. One way he does that is deliver, not just to Hoboken and parts of Jersey City but across the river to Manhattan, as long it's ''worth my while,'' he said with a laugh. Once or twice a month, Piccolo's even delivers some 225 sandwiches to Wall Street by ferry. Besides a minimum order of 15 sandwiches and a pickup at the ferry terminal, Patty requires one more thing to make a delivery to the Big Apple: you must ''take care of the person who makes the delivery.'' Smart man, considering that that person is sometimes his father.

(Random House, $23.95.) The first book by a promising Canadian writer who devises and explores different forms with interesting results; the 68-page story at the heart of this volume probes World War I by seeing what it does to a 26-year-old pair of twin sisters who have volunteered to work in France.    BAY OF SOULS, by Robert Stone. (Houghton Mifflin, $25.) A highly concentrated (for this author), wholly unnerving novel whose hero, an unhappy professor of English specializing in literary ''vitalism,'' becomes desperately involved with an exotically attractive woman who thinks she has lost her soul and hopes to retrieve it in a voodoo rite.    THE BOOK OF SALT, by Monique Truong. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A lush, fascinating, expansive first novel about exile, concerning a gay Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris; he Frenchifies their apple pie while observing with an aching heart how much better adapted to expatriation they are than he is.    POSITIVELY FIFTH STREET: Murderers, Cheetahs, and Binion's World Series of Poker, by James McManus. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Assigned to cover the event for Harper's Magazine, McManus entered the tournament and finished fifth, winning a fair bundle and a useful point of view not often accessible to the literati.    THINGS MY MOTHER NEVER TOLD ME, by Blake Morrison. (Granta, $24.95.) An ambitious epistolary memoir, drawing on a big cache of letters exchanged by Morrison's parents during World War II. Eavesdropping on their courtship lets him produce a remarkable home-front atmosphere with a special focus on his mother's concealment of her Irish origins.    THE FUTURE OF FREEDOM: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, by Fareed Zakaria. (Norton, $24.95.) The editor of Newsweek International updates Tocqueville's critique of popular government, expanding its reach to the world; unlike Tocqueville, he does not see independent countervailing social institutions containing democracy's excesses.    THE COFFEE TRADER, by David Liss. (Random House, $24.95.) A historical novel and an economically detailed romance of capitalism, in which a young Jew in 17th-century Amsterdam seeks to evade censure from the Jewish authorities and to build a personal fortune by exploiting the rising popularity of coffee, which he intends to buy cheap and sell dear.    TERROR AND LIBERALISM, by Paul Berman. (Norton, $21.) This personal manifesto by a liberal interventionist tries to chart a course between right-wing ''realists'' and left-wing ''anti-imperialists'' now that the totalitarian mental modes of Communism and fascism have been inherited by angry Muslims.    A FEW SHORT NOTES ON TROPICAL BUTTERFLIES: Stories, by John Murray. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) Stories by a doctor whose understated authorial presence and gift for description are strong enough to sustain an occasionally underconstructed narrative.

The set covers the years from 1958 to 1963, as well as the distance from Mr. Weston the player of piquant, swinging miniatures with a profound extreme-register style to Mr. Weston the concocter of large-ensemble evocations of Africa. Unlike Ellington, who used African and Asian elements with a very conscious air of paraphrase, Mr. Weston wanted to make the link more explicit. And that's what Langston Hughes's liner essay to the 1960 album ''Uhuru Afrika,'' reprinted here, confirms. ''That jazz owes its basic debt to Africa, no one disputes,'' Hughes wrote. ''Therefore contemporary Africans did not really have to learn to play jazz because their own tribal music from time immemorial has contained the major elements that distinguish jazz from other musical forms.'' Wow, how simplified and yearning that reads now. Randy Weston loved music from many parts of Africa, and still does. But most of his aesthetic DNA comes from Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, who descended from the Harlem stride-piano players of the 20's, and all of those guys were as American as apple pie.", "abstract": "Ben Ratliff briefly describes new recordings of interest; photos (S)", "print_page": "23", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Wall of Sound From the Top of Foggy Mountain", "kicker": "MUSIC: PLAYLIST", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MUSIC: PLAYLIST; A Wall of Sound From the Top of Foggy Mountain", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Music", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2003-08-03T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Arts and Leisure Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "byline": {"original": "By Ben Ratliff", "person": [{"firstname": "Ben", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Ratliff", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/e79915b4-1294-5ec7-8df9-4d83780aa915", "word_count": 779, "uri": "nyt://article/e79915b4-1294-5ec7-8df9-4d83780aa915"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/25/technology/state-of-the-art-taking-their-lumps-of-coal.html", "snippet": "David Pogue State of the Art column humorously suggests what technology industry designers and executives might be receiving as holiday gifts; products for 'naughty' and 'nice' noted; drawing (M)", "lead_paragraph": "HO-HO-HOME electronics!", "abstract": "David Pogue State of the Art column humorously suggests what technology industry designers and executives might be receiving as holiday gifts; products for 'naughty' and 'nice' noted; drawing (M)", "print_page": "1", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Taking Their Lumps Of Coal", "kicker": "STATE OF THE ART", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "STATE OF THE ART; Taking Their Lumps Of Coal", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2003-12-25T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Circuits", "section_name": "Technology", "byline": {"original": "By David Pogue", "person": [{"firstname": "David", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Pogue", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/92b636a9-f441-51de-bdd4-617a38c6149b", "word_count": 1273, "uri": "nyt://article/92b636a9-f441-51de-bdd4-617a38c6149b"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/09/technology/news-watch-adapters-a-recharge-en-route.html", "snippet": "New power adapter from Mobility Products can charge laptops, hand-held devices and cellphones and works in automobiles, airplanes and indoors with standard electrical outlets; photo (S)", "lead_paragraph": "The iGo Juice from Mobility Products is for frequent travelers who want it all: a single power adapter that charges laptops, hand-held devices and cellphones and works in automobiles, airplanes and indoors with standard electrical outlets.", "abstract": "New power adapter from Mobility Products can charge laptops, hand-held devices and cellphones and works in automobiles, airplanes and indoors with standard electrical outlets; photo (S)", "print_page": "3", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Recharge En Route", "kicker": "NEWS WATCH: ADAPTERS", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH: ADAPTERS; A Recharge En Route", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "MOBILITY PRODUCTS", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Cellular Telephones", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Telephones and Telecommunications", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2003-01-09T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Circuits", "section_name": "Technology", "byline": {"original": "By Thomas J.

(Houghton Mifflin, $25.) A highly concentrated (for this author), wholly unnerving novel whose hero, an unhappy professor of English specializing in literary ''vitalism,'' becomes desperately involved with an exotically attractive woman who thinks she has lost her soul and hopes to retrieve it in a voodoo rite.    DARK STAR SAFARI: Overland From Cairo to Cape Town, by Paul Theroux. (Houghton Mifflin, $28.) The youngest curmudgeon grows older: Theroux turns 60 during this arduous trek and seems to resent it in a narrative suffused with ruin and oblivion, though he remains a mighty myth deflator and a master at the humor of ill humor.    REGARDING THE PAIN OF OTHERS, by Susan Sontag. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) In this long reflective essay, which examines photographs of calamities and the moral uses of looking at them, Sontag follows the trail of photojournalism from the Crimean War on and refines some of the observations of her 1977 book, ''On Photography.''    THE HOUSE ON BEARTOWN ROAD: A Memoir of Learning and Forgetting, by Elizabeth Cohen. (Random House, $23.95.) Was Cohen downhearted when her Alzheimered father was shipped to her? When her husband abandoned her and their baby? You bet! But from chaos, with help from the neighbors, she made this frank, funny, nonexploitative memoir.    W. C. FIELDS: A Biography, by James Curtis. (Knopf, $35.) A scrupulous, sympathetic life of the great performer who projected in his characters -- sly, blustering, bibulous loners protecting themselves with a smoke screen of gab -- reflections of real human nature as he had observed it for himself.    THE SONGS OF THE KINGS, by Barry Unsworth. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $26.) A modern retelling of Euripides' ''Iphigenia in Aulis'' in which seers struggle to see what god is holding up the invasion of Troy while Odysseus, a scheming political animal, works to unite the Greek army to preserve his chance of looting Troy and dying rich.    THE BOOK OF SALT, by Monique Truong. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A lush, fascinating, expansive first novel about exile, concerning a gay Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris; he Frenchifies their apple pie while observing with an aching heart how much better adapted to expatriation they are than he is.    A SHORTCUT THROUGH TIME: The Path to the Quantum Computer, by George Johnson. (Knopf, $24.) A science writer and veteran explainer communicates some of the propositions offered by theorists about the virtually unlimited computing power that may follow certain practical triumphs that are not quite in sight.    THE VOICE AT 3:00 A.M.: Selected Late & New Poems, by Charles Simic. (Harcourt, $25.) Tidy, blunt verses whose moral vision is rooted in an appreciation of the absurd; a surrealism of a sort that is always in position to raise existential questions about daily life.

(Knopf, $23.) Seeking to untangle the paradoxical relationship between the shy, fragile pianist and the passionate sexual outlaw and novelist George Sand, Eisler's biography underscores Chopin's illness and Sand's nursing skills, and sees a mutual attraction arising from their voracious appetite for work.    THE BOOK OF SALT, by Monique Truong. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A lush, expansive first novel, concerning a gay Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris; he Frenchifies their apple pie while observing with an aching heart how much better adapted to expatriation they are than he is.    TERROR AND LIBERALISM, by Paul Berman. (Norton, $21.) This personal manifesto by a liberal interventionist tries to chart a course between right-wing ''realists'' and left-wing ''anti-imperialists'' now that the totalitarian mental modes of Communism and fascism have been inherited by angry Muslims.    THE WIFE, by Meg Wolitzer. (Scribner, $23.) A light-footed, streamlined novel that rushes in to shed new heat on old themes like gender, writing and identity; Joan Castleman gives up her writing career to service that of her husband, Joe, a jerk of many flavors, and Wolitzer deploys a calm, seamless humor over the agony.    AFTER: How America Confronted the September 12 Era, by Steven Brill. (Simon & Schuster, $29.95.) Brill sets out, John Hersey fashion, to comprehend America's reaction to the terror attack by visiting the viewpoints of those he interviews: officials, lawyers, politicians of course, but regular folk as well; he discerns a peculiar American tendency for special interests to work together in time of crisis.    THE GATE, by Fran&#231;ois Bizot. (Knopf, $24.) Bizot, a French ethnologist seized by Cambodian rebels in 1971, recalls peculiar daily chat sessions over politics and philosophy with his chief captor, an obviously dangerous man who later ran one of the Khmer Rouge's ghastliest killing fields; after three months, Bizot was given an all-night farewell party and released.    GOOD MORNING MIDNIGHT: Life and Death in the Wild, by Chip Brown. (Riverhead, $24.95.) A searching biography, by a journalist, of Guy Waterman, a Republican suburbanite who became a born-again mountaineer in midlife, taking the White Mountains as his backyard; in February 2000, at 67, he killed himself by going outdoors and lying down in the cold.    EMPIRE: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power, by Niall Ferguson. (Basic Books, $35.) A young British historian argues that the empire did a lot of good and prevented a lot of evil, and invites the United States to reflect on the possibilities of its global reach.    MORENGA, by Uwe Timm. (New Directions, $25.95.) An intriguing, impressionistic novel of colonial warfare, published in Germany in 1978 and set in Germany's former African empire, where the suppression of the rebellious Herero tribe by a kind of state-sponsored genocide in 1904 seems to anticipate the Holocaust.

He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. He worked the dirt around in his mouth and swallowed, leaning his head back and opening his eyes in time to see the strip of sun fade to dark blue and then to nothing. He was the only man in the realm, slave or free, who ate dirt, but while the bondage women, particularly the pregnant ones, ate it for some incomprehensible need, for that something that ash cakes and apples and fatback did not give their bodies, he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because the eating of it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life.

Mass-market brands like Calgon bath products and Toni Perms, which became household names in the early 50's, have recently come out with repackaged versions of the original products. Next month, Dippity-do, the iconic bright pink or blue hair gel, will rerelease its original formula, along with the new Dippity-do Techno, a tweaked version for teenagers ($2.99 at CVS). In the higher-end cosmetic arena, Delux Beauty named its Tintsticks, sheer lip colors for spring, after 50's waitresses \u2014 Flossie, Darling, Dot and Betty. And Stila's spring makeup line is based on the corals and reds of the classic 50's palette. \"The 50's look is very appealing right now because it's so cinematic,\" said Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila. \"The look is all about black eyeliner, neutral eyeshadows, peachy coral cheeks and bright coral to red lips.

In 1620, Cornelius Jacobsen Mey, a Dutch explorer, navigated the coastline and gave his name to the area, though the spelling was later changed to May. Breeze-seeking Philadelphians eventually made Cape May one of the nation's first seaside resorts. Today, entrance to Cape May's two miles of public beaches requires adults to pay as they go ($4 per day, $8 for three days), in the form of beach tags, which are sold around town. While the fee may be a nuisance, it helps to ensure immaculate beaches. And although Victoriana is a major attraction in Cape May, you can also stumble upon rolling farmland, thick woods and semideserted dunes, just as past explorers did generations ago.

Working their way through the sharp thrusts and parries of Mr. Nichols's script, they're like Astaire and Rogers skating through a perilously waxed ballroom. The big difference is that while Fred and Ginger were figures of romantic perfection, Bri and Sheila are dancing from desperation. The director, Laurence Boswell, brings out the genuine warmth in the artifice of Mr. Nichols's script. And the fine supporting cast includes Madeleine Martin, Margaret Colin, Michael Gaston and, as Bri's cozily sufocating mother, the redoubtable Dana Ivey (2:45).

Mr. Strathairn delivers one of the most exquisitely nuanced performances of his career as Mr. Auster, a high school English teacher tempted to seduce his star pupil, Meg (Ms. Bruckner), a beautiful and talented aspiring poet. The characters are carefully rendered in shades of gray. The teacher is a sensitive aesthete and a caring friend, but also a lecher and a literary impostor. Meg, who grew up with her mother and her emotionally troubled younger sister in a home scarred by divorce, is part angel, part surly teenage rebel. The movie is an impressive debut for Ms. Moncrieff, whose wised-up psychological radar takes in both sides of every situation (Stephen Holden).", "print_page": "18", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MOVIE GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-05-16T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/f3b44566-12a4-5f32-8cf2-7307e6346312", "word_count": 2292, "uri": "nyt://article/f3b44566-12a4-5f32-8cf2-7307e6346312"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/03/travel/havens-weekender-andes-ny.html", "snippet": "Donna Paul article on Andes, NY, which has become popular place to have a weekend home; photo; map (M)", "lead_paragraph": "I FOUND Andes by mistake -- I drove into the village and felt an immediate affinity with the place,'' said Tom Munro, a Manhattan fashion photographer who shoots for Vogue and Details.

No movie title could be any less appropriate than ''Basic.'' Someone decided to make a procedural thriller by putting ''Rashomon'' in a Cuisinart along with ''A Few Good Men'' and ''A Soldier's Story,'' and hit the button for pulverize while forgetting to replace the top. The outcome is a spewing mess. In Panama six Army Rangers go out on a training exercise, led by their volatile, violently demanding -- and, of course, violently detested -- troop leader, Sergeant West (Mr. Jackson). When only two of the men return alive, an investigation begins. Hardy (Mr. Travolta), a bad-apple D.E.A. agent and former Ranger, is brought in to find out what went wrong. ''Basic'' is so desperate to get to its nonsensical ending that it sinks to having a dying man write a clue in his own blood. Probably the reason most people will be interested in ''Basic'' is for a reteaming of Mr. Travolta and Mr. Jackson for the first time since ''Pulp Fiction.'' They have only a moment together, and this picture could have the effect of negating the heat ''Pulp Fiction'' put under them (Elvis Mitchell).", "print_page": "27", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MOVIE GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-04-04T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/e32637c3-d9f3-56b3-a132-021984cdf5a1", "word_count": 2115, "uri": "nyt://article/e32637c3-d9f3-56b3-a132-021984cdf5a1"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/books/chapters/being-america.html", "snippet": "\"I have come here trying to understand the attraction and resentment, the imitation and rejection that America inspires everywhere.\"", "lead_paragraph": " Those masterful images, because complete ", "abstract": "\"I have come here trying to understand the attraction and resentment, the imitation and rejection that America inspires everywhere.\"", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "'Being America'", "kicker": "First Chapter", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "'Being America'", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-03-30T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Books / First Chapters", "section_name": "Books", "byline": {"original": "By Jedediah Purdy", "person": [{"firstname": "Jedediah", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Purdy", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Transcript", "_id": "nyt://article/3e1d444d-be82-5e1a-bd6c-643038202323", "word_count": 2202, "uri": "nyt://article/3e1d444d-be82-5e1a-bd6c-643038202323"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/19/arts/music/pop-and-jazz-listings.html", "snippet": "A selective listing by Times critics of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend.", "lead_paragraph": " Aselective listing by Times critics of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

This psych-out comedy threatens a high-concept peak: Mr. Sandler and Mr. Nicholson nose to nose. Dave Buznik (Mr. Sandler), a mild-mannered ad executive -- a man so soft-spoken he occasionally speaks as if he burned the roof of his mouth -- is caught in the middle of a huge altercation and misunderstanding on an airplane. He's sentenced to anger management, ordered by a judge to seek treatment from Dr. Buddy Rydell (Mr. Nicholson). After a few other mishaps, the court orders Rydell to move in with Dave. Rydell's manner -- smooth, rational explanations that bubble into hostile eruptions of id, in numbing alternation -- is so disruptive that he seems as much like a doctor as Dr. Bombay from the old ''Bewitched'' series. He seems to be announcing to the world that he's a charlatan, though what is eventually announced is that the halfhearted ''Anger Management'' isn't much of a movie, despite a few awe-inspiring touches of absurdity in David Dorfman's script. That flatness probably made Mr. Segal an apt director for the film. In the list of adjectives one could append to Mr. Segal, the word slick is not one of them; it seems beyond his means (Elvis Mitchell).", "print_page": "23", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MOVIE GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-04-18T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/9485e56c-18ad-5a4a-beb1-3a51fac2ff7f", "word_count": 2240, "uri": "nyt://article/9485e56c-18ad-5a4a-beb1-3a51fac2ff7f"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/14/arts/spare-times-986321.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "EVENTS", "abstract": " EVENTS    ''STEFAN WOLPE IN NEW YORK,'' City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street.

No movie title could be any less appropriate than ''Basic.'' Someone decided to make a procedural thriller by putting ''Rashomon'' in a Cuisinart along with ''A Few Good Men'' and ''A Soldier's Story,'' and hit the button for pulverize while forgetting to replace the top. The outcome is a spewing mess. In Panama six Army Rangers go out on a training exercise, led by their volatile, violently demanding -- and, of course, violently detested -- troop leader, Sergeant West (Mr. Jackson). When only two of the men return alive, an investigation begins. Hardy (Mr. Travolta), a bad-apple D.E.A. agent and former Ranger, is brought in to find out what went wrong. ''Basic'' is so desperate to get to its nonsensical ending that it sinks to having a dying man write a clue in his own blood. Probably the reason most people will be interested in ''Basic'' is for a reteaming of Mr. Travolta and Mr. Jackson for the first time since ''Pulp Fiction.'' They have only a moment together, and this picture could have the effect of negating the heat ''Pulp Fiction'' put under them (Elvis Mitchell).", "print_page": "24", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MOVIE GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-04-11T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/82c01f48-5de8-59b0-a410-354f9041ec08", "word_count": 2213, "uri": "nyt://article/82c01f48-5de8-59b0-a410-354f9041ec08"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/05/dining/at-my-table-why-make-yeast-a-forbidden-pleasure.html", "snippet": "Nigella Lawson column on rewards of cooking with yeast; gives recipes for sweet buns, blueberry kuchen and dinner rolls; photos (M)", "lead_paragraph": "I KNOW that baking with yeast can set even the experienced everyday cook running to the hills.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses.    Now Playing    ''ANGER MANAGEMENT,'' starring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 101 minutes). This psych-out comedy threatens a high-concept peak: Mr. Sandler and Mr. Nicholson nose to nose. Dave Buznik (Mr. Sandler), a mild-mannered ad executive -- a man so soft-spoken he occasionally speaks as if he had burned the roof of his mouth -- is caught in the middle of a huge altercation and misunderstanding on an airplane. He's sentenced to anger management, ordered by a judge to seek treatment from Dr. Buddy Rydell (Mr. Nicholson). After a few other mishaps the court orders Rydell to move in with Dave. Rydell's manner -- smooth, rational explanations that bubble into hostile eruptions of id, in numbing alternation -- is so disruptive that he seems as much like a doctor as Dr. Bombay from the old ''Bewitched'' series. He seems to be announcing to the world that he's a charlatan, though what is eventually announced is that the halfhearted ''Anger Management'' isn't much of a movie, despite a few awe-inspiring touches of absurdity in David Dorfman's script. That flatness probably made Mr. Segal an apt director for the film. In the list of adjectives one could append to Mr. Segal, the word slick is not one of them; it seems beyond his means (Elvis Mitchell).", "print_page": "26", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MOVIE GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2003-04-25T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/49d47e0b-f26c-5979-a272-1580189d5297", "word_count": 2359, "uri": "nyt://article/49d47e0b-f26c-5979-a272-1580189d5297"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/magazine/why-we-love-fashion-it-s-the-divas-shop-in-the-name-of-love.html", "snippet": "Actress Tracee Ellis Ross discusses her lifelong love of fashion, influenced by her mother, Diana Ross; interview with Lisa Eisner and Roman Alonso; photos of her in clothing belonging to both of them (special section, Fashions of The Times) (part...", "lead_paragraph": "Tracee Ellis Ross is a fashion plate.

Nipple clamps? No sir, not this time. Even one would just be, like, way generous. Seizing him by the neck with both hands, she raises her shins from the carpet and presses her full dead weight onto his rib cage and solar plexus, forcing more air from his lungs. How's that feel? As she rocks back and forth, they lock eyes. \"You like that?\" she asks, flirty as ever. \"How come?\" Her name is Sandra Murphy. When she wears clothes, her taste runs to Gucci, Victoria's Secret, Versace. Her latest ride is the SL 500, in black. She used to work at a high-end sports car emporium in Long Beach, so she knows what the good stuff is. After that gig she moved to Las Vegas and danced topless professionally, but she hasn't had to work in three years-not since she danced for the guy she is currently laying her hands on. \"My old man,\" she calls him sometimes, or \"my husband,\" especially since she moved in. And she would sort of like to get married. Settle down, kids, that whole deal. Not right now, though. Because you, you've got time , as Liz Phair advises in \"Polyester Bride,\" one of Sandy's all-time favorite songs. Time to get rich, see the world, party hearty. And lately she's been having the time of her used-to-be-not-so-great life. Million-dollar mansion, cute boyfriend, bionic sex, Benz, plus she's keeping her looks, above all. That's the key. In 1989 she was runner-up for the title of Miss Bellflower, a south-central suburb of Los Angeles. That was nine years ago, when Sandy was seventeen, but she maintains her dancer's physique by working out five days a week, and she still keeps the sash in her closet. Most men, her boyfriend included, cannot get enough of her, especially the way she looks now. She is lithe, wet, determined, on top.

Opera    ''BRUNDIBAR.'' Brundibar, or Bumblebee, is actually the bad guy in Hans Krasa's children's opera, which was the composer's last: he was killed at Auschwitz in 1944. A student of Zemlinsky, Krasa kept his idiom simple for his young performers, who were, like him, prisoners in Theresienstadt, also known as Terezin, the ''model'' concentration camp where the opera ran for more than 50 performances. (The children, too, were ultimately sent to Auschwitz.) This weekend's staging features members of the Young People's Chorus of New York City, whose average age is about 12, in roles like the Bird, the Cat and, of course, Brundibar, the evil organ grinder. The actor Eli Wallach will narrate, and Neal Goren conducts.

Only that he's 20 and what the N.B.A. auditors of flesh and bone call ''a freak'' enabled him to even imagine that he could make this play. From a little triangular section of seats right behind the Suns bench, reserved for homeboys, lovers, swindlers and kin, Stoudemire's people looked on. Among them was Marwan Stoudemire, Amare's 14-year-old half-brother, whom Amare brought west with him from central Florida and enrolled in a private Phoenix day school. Marwan is not a freak. He wears a metal cast of the Cartoon Network antihero ''The Brain'' on a chain around his neck, has a heartbreaking smile and soft, ancient eyes, and if anything, he is small and slight for a ninth grader.
