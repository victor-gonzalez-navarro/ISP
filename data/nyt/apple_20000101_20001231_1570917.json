Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:", "abstract": "  Philadelphia is 100 miles south of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:    Where to Stay     FOUR SEASONS, 1 Logan Square, (215) 963-1500. The opulent, flower-filled lobby tells the story: no expense has been spared here. But as one of the hotel's executives says, ''The mahogany and marble are the easy parts.'' The hard part is building a skilled, attentive, kindly staff, and the Seasons succeeds superbly on that count, too. The Fountain dining room, where Jean-Marie Lacroix has presided since 1983, is the peer of any restaurant in town. Computer connections, a bit dated, are to be modernized soon. Double room: $240 to $320, weekends; $305 to $400, weekdays.     LOEWS, 1200 Market Street, (215) 627-1200. A tip of the Apple hat to the Tisch family, which has converted the landmark PSFS building into a hotel of ravishing Art Deco beauty. The old vault doors and silvery sans-serif signs have been used to great graphic effect in the lobby, amidst acres of rosewood and etched glass. The 583 bedrooms murmur ''Hollywood, 1930,'' with a chaise longue in every one; a club-floor library holds vintage books. Double room:  $175 to $365.     RITTENHOUSE, 210 West Rittenhouse Square, (215) 546-9000. The harsh zigzag facade does little for the harmony of the urban environment, though it gives the 128 guest rooms leafy views. Otherwise, the Rittenhouse is hard to fault, with a central location, an invitingly cool lobby and bedrooms swimming with space. Each has a desk tucked into an alcove, a fax and a video tape player, plus a dressing area and a marble bathroom with an oversize tub and separate stall shower. The low-key service is charmingly accommodating. Double rooms from $360; occasional weekend specials from $200.    Where to Eat     LE BEC-FIN, 1523 Walnut Street, (215) 567-1000. When Paul Bocuse visited Georges Perrier's formal little jewel box, with its raspberry-pink walls and tapestry-covered chairs, he pronounced it ''a real restaurant, more like Lyons than New York.'' The cooking is classical, lightened and brightened here and there with an Asian spice like Sichuan pepper. European fish (loup, turbot) are a specialty, as are desserts, dispensed from a calorie chariot five levels high. Great cheeses; great, very costly French wines.     FORK, 306 Market Street, (215) 625-9425. With bare floors, an open kitchen, and a fixation on freshness worthy of Alice Waters, this is the perfect place for lunch on a tour of the city's Colonial shrines. Try the satisfyingly rustic chicken-mushroom-barley soup, a fishy or meaty salad and the chocolate cake with banana gelato, plus a beer from the cosmopolitan list.     PASION!, 211 South 15th Street, (215) 875-9895. For my money, Guillermo Pernot's nuevo Latino cooking is the most exciting in Philadelphia at the moment. A superlative chili-laced ceviche of Chilean sea bass and seaweed, presented alongside a scallop shell, is served with big smiles in a tented room full of palms and bright fabrics. Likewise, an Argentine mixed grill, a Haitian empanada and the very best Chilean wines.     PAT'S KING OF STEAKS, Ninth and Wharton Streets, (215) 468-1546. This is the real deal: these are the folks who gave the world the Philly cheese steak -- thinly sliced, quickly grilled beef, slapped onto an Italian roll, slathered with Cheez-Whiz, topped with onions. Pat's stands on a triangular traffic island in the heart of Rocky country, South Philadelphia, across the street from an asphalt basketball court. You order your sandwich at a tiny window and eat it at a plastic table, right on the street. It's silly, sloppy and, in its own way, sublime.     STRIPED BASS, 1500 Walnut Street, (215) 732-4444. The lofty ceilings and the marble columns of this erstwhile banking hall, built in 1927, always put me in a mellow mood, as do the Fortuny lighting fixtures and the snazzy metal fish hanging overhead. Terence Feury, an alumnus of Le Bernardin in Manhattan, has refreshed a tired menu with distinctive, unpompous dishes like crisp-skinned striped bass (what else?) served on a tangle of bitter greens.     SUSANNA FOO, 1512 Walnut Street, (215) 545-2666. Born in Mongolia, Sue Foo, as the local Asian grocers like to call her, is equally at home with Asian and European culinary traditions. In a dining room full of orchids and Asian art, she serves a trio of dumplings (shrimp, duck, lobster), each in a deliciously different wrapper, and dares to pair fish in a tangy, winy sauce with sweet rice. Five-spice Pennsylvania venison is another hit.     TANGERINE, 232 Market Street, (215) 627-5116. This semi-nightclub is the town's hot spot, so you have to put up with noise, semi-pro service and dim, candle-lighted, souk-like passageways. But most of the Moroccan fantasy food is well worth it, notably gnocchi with dates and harissa and a honey-and-lamb tagine, cooked in a crockery dish with a top shaped like a coolie's hat. The fish and the duck are overdone. Comfortably low-backed leather chairs; dandy desserts (chocolate cake streaked with tangerine) from Laurie Shapiro.    Attractions     ACADEMY OF MUSIC, 1420 Locust Street, at Broad Street, (215) 893-1999. The next program is the Pennsylvania Ballet's production of ''Dracula,'' opening Wednesday and running through June 11. Tickets: $15 to $86. The Philadelphia Orchestra begins its fall season in Sept.; June 18-19, Harry Connick Jr.     BARNES FOUNDATION, 300 North Latch's Lane, Merion, Pa., (610) 667-0290 (press 5 for reservations) or fax date, time, number of visitors and credit card number to (610) 667-8315. Reservations are required. Hours: September through June open Fridays through Sundays, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; July and August, Wednesdays through Fridays, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5.     INDEPENDENCE HALL, Chestnut Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets, (215) 597-8974.

(Grove, paper, $14.) A lively account of the unsung heroes of popular music, the club D.J.'s who in their enthusiasm and their technical competence developed the ears of nearly everyone else and led the music almost everywhere it has gone.    AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The main narrator in this novel by a New York investment banker is a low, corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system. It's easy to brand him despicable because he is, but his power to do ill is limited, his personality complex and his author compassionate.    A HOLE IN THE EARTH, by Robert Bausch. (Harcourt, $24.) Bausch's fourth novel concerns Henry Porter, 39, the sole flop in a family of successes, whose fixation in preternatural adolescence is mitigated by his own humiliations and the kindness of others.    JEW VS. JEW: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry, by Samuel G. Freedman. (Simon & Schuster, $26.) A journalism professor, once a reporter for The Times, explores the frictions that have risen in America, especially between the Orthodox and the less Orthodox, and envisions a possible future in which religion alone will be the determinant of who is Jewish and who not.    THE SECRET PARTS OF FORTUNE: Three Decades of Intense Investigations and Edgy Enthusiasms, by Ron Rosenbaum. (Random House, $29.95.) A generous collection of journalism by a writer who has exposed himself to many of the great obsessions of the 20th century without losing his curiosity, his skepticism or his willingness to listen.    I LOVED YOU ALL, by Paula Sharp. (Hyperion, $23.95.) An old-fashioned storytelling novel about the escalating defiance of hard-line anti-abortionists in the 1970's; the leading character (on the side that is clearly not the author's) has the depth and energy to become indispensable to people whose lives or children are out of control.    THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, by Catherine Bush. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A novel with the nerve to use war as a metaphor for the travails of love; its protagonist, a graduate in war studies, has fled Canada after two men fought a duel over her.    SISTER: The Life of the Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II, by Apple Parish Bartlett and Susan Bartlett Crater. (St. Martin's, $35.) An oral history, compiled by the daughter and granddaughter of the aristocrat who went into the decorating business in 1933 and lived a life characterized by robust frivolity and hard work.    BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Liberalism, under one or another definition, is the force that shaped and eventually failed the author's grandfather (a Congressman from Alabama), his father (a legal scholar and student of procedure) and himself (once a Peace Corps volunteer, now a writer).

(Simon & Schuster, $30.) An education expert who has often run with conservatives argues that 20th-century ''progressive'' theorists watered down education for non-elites in the name of ''life adjustment'' and other slogans, depriving those very groups of the knowledge to help them rise.    THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography, by Godfrey Hodgson. (Houghton Mifflin, $38.) A life of the right's favorite liberal, or the left's favorite neocon, always intelligent, usually correct and at peace with his impending retirement; by a British journalist and friend.    KHOMEINI: Life of the Ayatollah, by Baqer Moin. (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $27.95.) An Iranian (and former Muslim seminarian) gives a deft account of the background and rise to power of the gifted, shrewd cleric and politician who destroyed Iran's monarchy and forever changed the course of its history.    AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The main narrator in this novel by a New York investment banker is a low, corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system. It's easy to brand him despicable because he is, but his power to do ill is limited, his personality complex and his author compassionate.    BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Liberalism, under one or another definition, is the force that shaped and eventually failed the author's grandfather (a Congressman from Alabama), his father (a legal scholar and student of procedure) and himself (once a Peace Corps volunteer, now a writer, and though bloodied not yet totally bowed).    A HOLE IN THE EARTH, by Robert Bausch. (Harcourt, $24.) Bausch's fourth novel concerns Henry Porter, 39, the sole flop in a family of successes, whose fixation in preternatural adolescence is mitigated by his own humiliations and the kindness of others.    THE SECRET PARTS OF FORTUNE: Three Decades of Intense Investigations and Edgy Enthusiasms, by Ron Rosenbaum. (Random House, $29.95.) A generous collection of journalism by a writer who has exposed himself to many of the great obsessions of the 20th century without losing his curiosity, his skepticism or his willingness to listen.    I LOVED YOU ALL, by Paula Sharp. (Hyperion, $23.95.) An old-fashioned storytelling novel about the escalating defiance of hard-line anti-abortionists in the 1970's; the leading character (on the side that is clearly not the author's) has the depth and energy to become indispensable to people whose lives or children are out of control.    SISTER: The Life of the Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II, by Apple Parish Bartlett and Susan Bartlett Crater. (St. Martin's, $35.) An oral history, compiled by the daughter and granddaughter of the formidably descended aristocrat who went into the decorating business in 1933 and lived a life characterized by robust frivolity and hard work.

(Riverhead, $24.95.) Years of fruitless wishing for the great good place finally paid off for the author with a gracious old house upstate; her wisdom is shown by acknowledging that snakes and bad neighbors go with the territory just as flowers and moonbeams do.    SYDNEY: The Story of a City, by Geoffrey Moorhouse. (Harcourt, $25.) A virtuoso exposition of Sydney and the social history that has formed it, from the first Europeans and the British convicts through the gold rushes to the variety of today's Asian immigrants.    A RUM AFFAIR: A True Story of Botanical Fraud, by Karl Sabbagh. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A grave and witty account of a British amateur botanist who in the late 1940's caught a professor faking evidence to suit his theory about the last ice age and the Hebridean island of Rum, then sealed his report of the fraud in his college library (it leaked anyhow).    SISTER: The Life of the Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II, by Apple Parish Bartlett and Susan Bartlett Crater. (St. Martin's, $35.) An oral history, compiled by the daughter and granddaughter of the formidably descended aristocrat who went into the decorating business in 1933 and lived a life characterized by robust frivolity and lots of hard work.    THE QUESTION OF BRUNO, by Aleksandar Hemon. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $22.95.) Mostly fictional (but who can say for sure?) stories and a novella, invoking both the terrible facts of Bosnia and Yugoslavia and the years of the author's childhood, when there was yet hope for both.    THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography, by Godfrey Hodgson. (Houghton Mifflin, $38.) A life of the right's favorite liberal, or the left's favorite neocon, always intelligent, usually correct and at peace with his impending retirement; by a British journalist and longtime friend.    DREAM STUFF: Stories, by David Malouf. (Pantheon, $22.) Australia, in the short fiction of this collection, is a place of surprises and changing potential where history itself is sometimes in question and characters protest against loss, though the author seems to assure us that nothing is lost forever.    THE LOST LEGENDS OF NEW JERSEY, by Frederick Reiken. (Harcourt, $24.) The drama of sheer ordinariness receives its celebration in this novel set in northern New Jersey about 1980; the Jewish and Italian families who inhabit it struggle (especially the teenagers) for both stability and poetry.    TOUCHING PEACE: From the Oslo Accord to a Final Agreement, by Yossi Beilin. (Weidenfeld/Trafalgar Square, $50.) Israel's chief negotiator at Oslo and Stockholm gives a personal account of the secret talks with the P.L.O. that outlined the probable shape of any future Middle East peace, regardless of the outcome of the recent Barak-Arafat-Clinton meetings at Camp David.

What is going on here? Some kind of strange supernatural event? Is this the latest movie to explore the possibility of parallel realities, to imagine a kind of lived hypertext? For its first hour, Raul Ruiz's film, adapted from a novel by the Italian writer Massimo Bontempelli called ''The Boy With Two Mothers,'' weaves an elegant spell of epistemological confusion. The quiet, elegant Parisian interiors take on a spooky, claustrophobic feel, which is intensified by the odd behavior of the people who inhabit them. Camille's uncle Serge (Charles Berling), a psychiatrist, is prone to odd mood swings; the au pair, Helene, sulks passive-aggressively around the house; and Isabella has a creepy neighbor whose most banal utterances sound mysterious, even threatening.

W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville with its highly polished, unabridged version of Handel's ''Messiah,'' complete with professional soloists (516) 299-3100.    Different Drummers    The holiday lineup this week brings some lesser-performed music, too. Today, the Choral Society of the Hamptons sings ''A German Baroque Christmas,'' a program of Bach cantatas and sacred pieces by Praetorius and Schutz, at 5 and 7:30 p.m. at the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church on Main Street (631) 324-1891. On Friday, the Stony Brook Camerata and Women's Chorus concentrate on English composers with Britten's ''Ceremony of Carols'' and works by Vaughan Williams and Tavener at 8 p.m. at Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University (631) 632-2787, while the Moscow Boys Choir visits the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center on Main Street at 8 p.m. with ''Christmas Around the World'' featuring a potpourri of international holiday tunes (631) 288-1500. The Long Island Symphonic Choral Association has Saturday to itself for Monteverdi's ''Vespers of 1610,'' a work for double chorus, soloists, orchestra, harpsichord and organ, at 8 p.m. at the St. James Catholic Church on Route 25A in Setauket (631) 751-2743.    Pops Approach    The Long Island Philharmonic offers such pops classics as ''Winter Wonderland,'' ''Let It Snow,'' ''White Christmas'' and ''Oh Hannukah'' today at 4 p.m. with ''Bravo! Holidays,'' a family concert at Tilles Center in Brookville. Performed by the cast of ''Bravo! Broadway,'' the concert, under Randall Craig Fleischer's baton, will also feature Sean-Avram Carpenter and Lauren-Sarah Carpenter, brother and sister violinists, who won the Long Island Philharmonic's 1997 and 2000 Young Artist Competition, respectively, in a duet of ''Winter'' from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.'' The concert will help raise money to send the East Meadow High School Marching Band to the Orange Bowl (516) 299-3100.    On Their Toes    While ''The Nutcracker'' is as much a part of this holiday season as Handel's ''Messiah'' -- there are seven different productions on the Island this week -- naturally not every ballet company conforms. So Ballet New York, the new troupe based in Glen Cove, will open its annual performance today at 2 p.m. at the Maguire Theater on the Old Westbury campus of the State University with the premiere of a new work. It is ''Wanderers in the Light,'' a one-act ballet set to music by Rachmaninoff that was inspired by ''Street,'' which Konstantin Uralsky, the company's artistic director, created by commission for a Unicef gala at the Kremlin in Moscow in 1999. The ballet, the choreographer said, is ''a look at the human experience on the brink of the new millennium.'' ''Sounds of the Holiday,'' with, yes, excerpts from ''The Nutcracker,'' completes the program. (516) 656-3232.    Ballet Long Island, the company based in Bohemia, also defies convention this year. Well, almost. In addition to its traditional ''Nutcracker'' which on Saturday begins its run through Dec. 23 at Town Hall West on Main Street in Islip, the troupe will also expand its repertory with ''The Fantastic Toyshop,'' on Saturday and Dec. 19; ''Snow White,'' next Sunday and Dec. 21; and ''A Christmas Carol,'' Dec. 20 and 23 (631) 567-4403.    Wildlife Watch    Sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean and Shinnecock Bay, Dune Road, which runs from Quogue Village to the Shinnecock Inlet, is a great place to view wildlife on the East End, no matter what the season. Today, from noon to 2 p.m., naturalists from the Group for the South Fork take nature lovers on a walk along this thoroughfare on which the group eventually hopes to establish a self-guided wildlife viewing trail. Hikers will be on the lookout for the shorebirds, waterfowl and harbor seals that inhabit the salt marshes, mudflats and open waters bordering the road (631) 537-1400.    'Sound and Fury'    When it comes to family drama, reality can make fiction pale. That's the case with ''Sound and Fury,'' a documentary that begins a seven-day run at the Cinema Arts Center in Huntington on Friday. The film takes an up-close and personal look at the Artinians, a deaf family from Glen Cove split by the desire of its 6-year-old daughter, Heather, for a cochlear implant. The medical treatment would make her part of the hearing world, alienating her from her parents and two brothers and their deaf identity. The subjects of the film and Josh Aronson, its director, and Roger Weisberg, its producer, will appear at the screening at 7 p.m. on Saturday. The center is on Park Avenue (631) 423-7610.    Youth Reigns    Young musicians and song-and-dance performers are all the rage this week on the Island. Today, the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra of New York, 250-members strong, showcases the talents of the youngsters ages 8 to 18 and from 73 different communities in Nassau, Suffolk, Queens and Manhattan who make up the eight-year-old organization's three performing units, the Principal, Concert and String Orchestras. Starting at 4 p.m. at Berner Middle School on Carman's Mill Road in Massapequa, the youngsters will play works by Chabrier, Dvorak, Handel and Sibelius and Joseph Schwantner's ''New Morning for the World,'' a piece about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. which they will perform in January in Albany at New York State's celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (516) 365-2599.    Talent of another kind will be showcased on Saturday when ''The Broadway Kids'' make their Long Island debut at the Landmark on Main Street in Port Washington. These youngsters, all of whom have performed on Broadway, will recreate the children-friendly tunes featured in the popular ''Broadway Kids'' CD series: from ensemble numbers to solos from such shows as ''Annie,'' ''Oliver,'' ''Les Miserables,'' ''Pippin'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' The revue will be offered at 3 and 7 p.m. (516) 767-6444.    Free Choices    TODAY  With time out for their leader, Luis Cordero, to discuss the ''whys and hows'' of his emigration to the United States, Los Amigos de la Amargue perform traditional meringue music from the Dominican Republic at 2 p.m. at the Parrish Art Museum on Job's Lane in Southampton (631) 283-2118.    Martin Goldsmith, the National Public Radio commentator, discusses ''The Inextinguishable Symphony,'' his book about his parents' involvement in an orchestra founded by the Nazis for Jews, at 1:30 p.m. at the Holocaust Memorial and Educational Center of Nassau County on Crescent Beach Road in Glen Cove (516) 571-8040.    The Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera Company of Long Island offers ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Christmas Carol,'' combining lines from the Dickens work like ''Bah, humbug'' with tunes like ''Titwillow, titwillow,'' at 2:30 p.m. at the Merrick Library on Merrick Avenue (516) 379-3476.    WEDNESDAY  The Cold Spring Harbor Fish Hatchery and Aquarium on Route 25A holds a ''Holiday Open House'' from 1 to 5 p.m., inviting folks in to tour the place, ask questions about the fish, amphibians and reptiles on the premises, and, just incidentally, visit the gift shop (516) 692-6768.    SATURDAY  On Saturday, Handel's ''Messiah'' gets a more modest treatment in Massapequa via community singers when the Long Island Concert Chorale and St. Rose of Lima Choir present parts one and two at 8 p.m. in a free concert at St. Rose of Lima Church on Merrick Road (516) 946-7207.    The Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary on Cove Road in Oyster Bay holds an open house, its ''Traditional Sanctuary Winter Celebration'' from 2 to 4 p.m., with tree decorating and apple cider and hot-chocolate treats (516) 922-3200.    Cecelia Brauer plays the glass armonica, the instrument made of glass bowls that Benjamin Franklin invented and that the likes of Beethoven and Mozart composed music for.

And Orsay has put the period on the sentence. Glenn Bernbaum, Mortimer's notoriously highhanded and cranky owner, made sure the restaurant would not survive him. He arranged to have the name retired at his death, two years ago, and barred his former employees from operating a restaurant on the premises. Undeterred, they moved two blocks south and created Swifty's, where the spirit of Mortimer's has migrated with surprising ease, along with the Mortimer's ''in'' crowd.

Stewart.  Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.    A journalist tells the story of a doctor suspected of killing at least 35 hospital patients, and indicts the medical authorities who failed to protect the public. Last year our reviewer, Lance Morrow, called this a ''chillingly thorough and superbly matter-of-fact . . . reconstruction that has the fascination of an acutely observed and troubling novel.''    Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice  By A. S. Byatt. Vintage International, $12.    A British writer whose work explores the intersection of aesthetics and morality spins tales in which stolid, blinkered Europeans from the North become either imprisoned or re-energized by the earthier South and the warmer-blooded people (mostly artists) who live there. In Byatt's eyes, it is an unforgivable crime not to be curious about a world ''full of light and life.'' ''Byatt's prose is capacious yet exquisite,'' Fernanda Eberstadt wrote in the Book Review in 1999, and this collection is infused with ''the throwaway gleams of a writer at the height of her powers.''    The Distance to the Moon:  A Road Trip Into the American Dream  By James Morgan. Riverhead, $12.95.    The author explores America's obsessive love affair with cars and car culture as he drives from Miami to Portland, Ore., in a shiny new Porsche. ''The human case for the automobile has never been more persuasively presented,'' Bruce McCall wrote here last year. I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years Away, by Bill Bryson (Broadway, $14), is a collection of humorous dispatches written for a British newspaper about the author's bumpy re-entry into his native culture with his English wife and four children. ''The best columns are those in which the author discards his hapless persona and allows his natural impatience and intelligence out of their cages,'' Elizabeth Gleick said here in 1999.    True at First Light  By Ernest Hemingway.  Edited by Patrick Hemingway. Scribner, $13.    This fictional chronicle of an African safari, which was abandoned by Hemingway and edited by one of his sons, is a pale imitation of the writer's best work, James Wood said here last year. Nonetheless, ''there is a kind of mottled glamour, made up of bullying integrity and nonsense, of truth and falsity, which always makes the least of Hemingway's books compelling.''    1185 Park Avenue: A Memoir  By Anne Roiphe. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.    Avoiding sentimentality and self-pity in favor of an emotionally mature distance, the author tells of growing up Jewish in the 1940's and 50's with everything she could want but her parents' affection. ''Roiphe gives her memoir the dramatic vividness of a novel,'' Karen Lehrman wrote in these pages in 1999.    Apples From the Desert: Selected Stories  By Savyon Liebrecht. Feminist Press, $13.95.    This collection of 12 stories originally published in Israel focuses on the fault lines between secular and Orthodox Jews, bereft parents and their torn children. ''At her best, Liebrecht is the equal of far better-known Israeli authors like Amos Oz,'' Suzanne Ruta said here in 1998.    Mother of Pearl  By Melinda Haynes.  Washington Square/Pocket Books, $13.95.    This first novel revolves around a large cast of characters in sleepy Petal, Miss., in the 1950's, including Even Grade, a black orphan named for a road, and Valuable Korner, a fatherless white girl named after a real estate sign. Last year our reviewer, Roy Hoffman, admired the book's ''profuse and vigorous'' language.    George III: A Personal History  By Christopher Hibbert. Basic Books, $18.    As portrayed here, George III (1738-1820) was a churchgoing, monogamous, mostly competent ruler before going famously mad. His oldest son, however, George IV (1762-1830), the subject of Prince of Pleasure: The Prince of Wales and the Making of the Regency, by Saul David (Grove, $15), led the field in scandalous behavior at a time when London was the world's capital for debauchery. '' 'George III' and 'Prince of Pleasure' make a simply unputdownable theater of the personal and political absurd,'' Valentine Cunningham wrote here last year.    The Houdini Girl  By Martyn Bedford. Vintage Crime, $13.    After his Irish girlfriend dies in a mysterious train accident, a British magician discovers she led a double life and sets out to unravel her carefully hidden past. Last year our reviewer, Carey Harrison, called this ''a masterfully choreographed'' erotic thriller.    Poachers: Stories  By Tom Franklin. HarperPerennial, $12.    Set in lower Alabama, these mordant tales feature sympathetic good old boys stuck in bad situations, frayed marriages and dead-end jobs. ''With this satisfying collection'' Franklin ''establishes himself as one of the region's more interesting emerging voices,'' Bruce Barcott said here last year.

This retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about Chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is. The art, by contrast with so much Rococo art, is about love, not sex. Quiet and deliberation were Chardin's essential ingredients, combined with a perfect mastery of abstract form. He was the best still-life painter ever because he made the most of the least, his work focusing on the same humble cups and pans in one painting after another, one decade after another. The result was a compilation of precise little observations that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art.

Now Playing   * ''ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R, 101 minutes; winner of best foreign-language film Oscar). A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women; Mr. Almodovar has aptly described his material as ''screwball drama.'' Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).     * ''AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey (winner of best-actor Oscar), Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes; winner of best picture, director, cinematography and original-screenplay Oscars). With heavenly finesse, Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Maslin).     * ''BEAU TRAVAIL,'' starring Denis Lavant and Gregoire Colin. Directed by Claire Denis (not rated, 90 minutes). A loose adaptation of ''Billy Budd,'' moved to the present and set in the East African enclave of Djibouti, Ms. Denis's finest film to date observes the day-to-day rituals of a troop of French Legionnaires training in a harshly beautiful wasteland. The  visually spellbinding movie depicts their rigorous drills and rituals as ecstatic rites of purification and the embodiment of an impenetrable masculine mystique. In this version of  the allegory, the Claggart figure, Sergeant Galoup (Mr. Lavant), is a disillusioned officer, and his prey (Mr. Colin) a soldier whose humanity offends the sergeant. Not to be missed (Stephen Holden).     * ''BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank (winner of best-actress Oscar) and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).     * ''THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,'' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo and Michael Caine (winner of best suporting actor Oscar). Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes). Radically downsized in scope and its examination of the issue of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with an Oscar-winning Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the world. Mr. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent  brought up in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Mr. Caine), who performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms. Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940's ''David Copperfield'' (Holden).     * ''THE COLOR OF PARADISE,'' starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein Mahjur. Directed by Majid Majidi (PG, 90 minutes). This beautiful Iranian movie about a widowed father who is reluctant to care for his blind 8-year-old son is a heartbreaker done with such  conviction that it avoids mawkishness. When the special school the boy has been attending  won't keep him on, the father takes his son first to the family's woodland homestead, then  leaves him in the care of a blind carpenter. The movie evokes nature with an ecstatic sensuousness, and its heady soundtrack teems with the sounds of birds, insects, wind and rain (Holden).     ''ERIN BROCKOVICH,'' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising, effective beginning in which Ms. Roberts proves what a fine actress she can be and Mr. Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of the most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, ''Erin Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice Hollywood melodrama, a smooth secondhand amalgam of ''Norma Rae'' and ''Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ''The Rainmaker'' and ''A Civil Action.'' Ms. Roberts, playing a working-class single mother who spearheads an effort to win justice for victims of corporate negligence, aggressively solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting for about 40 minutes, Ms. Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and phony populism. It's as if she had a clause in her contract strictly limiting anyone else's right to be attractive or appealing on screen. Who could have foreseen that Mr. Soderbergh, the most brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers, could have made a movie so utterly hokey and conventional? (A. O. Scott).     ''GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'' starring Forest Whitaker. Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Mr. Jarmusch does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for the western in ''Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ''Ghost Dog'' is worth seeing for Mr. Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Mr. Jarmusch's offbeat sense of cinematic style and for the hip-hop artist the RZA's brilliant musical effects (Scott).     * ''HIGH FIDELITY,'' starring John Cusack,  Jill Peterson, Iben Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107 minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995 novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Mr. Cusack has one of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager and vinyl  fanatic sorting through the ''Top 5'' breakups in his disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of not-so-young men for whom pop music is a  kind of religion and hip musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).     ''MISSION TO MARS,'' starring Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins. Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113 minutes). This film's visual design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian surface look so real that the picture could have been made on location. But the movie is undermined by Mr. De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Mr. Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell).     ''THE NINTH GATE,'' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella. Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Mr. Langella is Boris Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired antiquities who hires Dean Corso (Mr. Depp), a weedy rogue book dealer, to locate a volume called ''The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan get Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book?  Mr. Polanski is out to cross ''Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof ''The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ''The Blair Witch Project,'' and not nearly as funny (Mitchell).     * ''NOT ONE LESS,'' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title), sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive power of Vittorio De Sica's ''Bicycle Thief'' (Scott).     ''THE ROAD TO EL DORADO,'' with the  voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh and Rosie Perez. Directed by Eric Bibo Bergeron and Don Paul (PG, 89 minutes). This animated buddy movie aspires to the airiness of a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby ''road'' romp but it's  hopelessly bland even by those timid 1940's standards. Mr. Kline and Mr. Branagh provide the nearly interchangeable voices of two perky con men who foil Hernando Cortes's 1519 invasion of the mythical El Dorado. Though scenic and fast-paced, the main characters have no life, and the movie plays history false. Elton John and Tim Rice provided six clunky songs (Holden).     ''WAKING THE DEAD,'' starring Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Keith Gordon (R, 106 minutes). Mr. Gordon's earnest screen adaptation of Scott Spencer's popular novel about a love that transcends death aspires to be a kind of intellectualized ''Love Story,'' set in the 1970's counterculture. But the blend of history and heartbreak doesn't quite jell. Mr. Crudup, as a rising Chicago politician, and Ms. Connelly, as his radical activist girlfriend who dies in a car bombing, have good chemistry. But the movie is so busy jumping back and forth between the past and present that it is continually stumbling over itself and breaking its own spell (Holden).     * ''WINTER SLEEPERS,'' starring Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem, Floriane Daniel and Heino Ferch. Directed by Tom Tykwer (not rated, 124 minutes). Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ''Run Lola Run'' put Mr. Tykwer on the short list of major international filmmakers, ''Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise afflicting the generation in its late 20's and 30's. But like ''Run Lola Run,'' this movie is also about how human destiny has everything to do with split-second timing (Holden).    Film Series     ''FOR OPENERS: THE ART OF FILM TITLES.'' In the beginning are the titles. Blending image, sound, music and text, they enhance the experience of moviegoing by setting the mood and presenting the themes of a film. Today and tomorrow, the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater is presenting a tribute to movie title designers and their work in an event that includes two panels, two illustrated presentations and two programs of short films. At 6 tonight, predigital designers like Pablo Ferro (''Dr. Strangelove'') and Wayne Fitzgerald (''Bonnie and Clyde'') are to discuss their work, and at 8:15 the writer Ken Coupland and the designer David Peters are to show and discuss some 20 classic and rarely seen sequences from 1950 to 1980 by Saul Bass, Maurice Binder, Mr.  Ferro, Robert Greenberg and others for directors like Stanley Donen, Blake Edwards, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Otto Preminger. At 6:15 p.m. tomorrow, a new generation of motion picture graphic designers like Randy Balsmeyer (''Magnolia'') and Deborah Ross (''The Talented Mr. Ripley'') are to discuss and show their work and at 8:15 Mr. Coupland and Mr. Peters are to discuss and show film titles from 1980 to the present. The tribute continues through tomorrow at the Walter Reade, at Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; $5 for Film Society members. Information: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

Now Playing    * ''AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).    * ''BOILER ROOM,'' starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ben Affleck. Written and directed by Ben Younger (R, 110 minutes). Mr. Ribisi portrays a young stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night company called J. T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street,'' ''Boiler Room'' tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise, fall and redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Mr. Ribisi's Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage -- a troubled relationship with his demanding, disapproving father -- onto the trading floor. But at its best, which is awfully good, ''Boiler Room'' avoids the thumping moralism that has made Mr. Stone the least misunderstood director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about feeling your oats (A. O. Scott).    * ''BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).    * ''THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,'' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes). Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the world. Mr. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms. Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940's ''David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).    ''ERIN BROCKOVICH,'' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising, effective beginning, in which Ms. Roberts proves what a fine actress she can be, and Mr. Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of the most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, ''Erin Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice Hollywood melodrama, a smooth secondhand amalgam of ''Norma Rae'' and ''Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ''The Rainmaker'' and ''A Civil Action.'' Ms. Roberts, playing a working-class single mother who spearheads an effort to win justice for victims of corporate negligence, aggressively solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting for about 40 minutes, Ms. Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and phony populism. It's as though she had a clause in her contract strictly limiting anyone else's right to be attractive or appealing on screen. Who could have foreseen that Mr. Soderbergh, the most brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers, could have made a movie so utterly hokey and conventional? (Scott).    ''GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'' starring Forest Whitaker. Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Mr. Jarmusch does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for the western in ''Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ''Ghost Dog'' is worth seeing for Mr. Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Mr. Jarmusch's offbeat sense of cinematic style and for the hip-hop artist the RZA's brilliant musical effects (Scott).    * ''THE HURRICANE,'' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a triple murder he denied committing, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a movie redeemed by Mr. Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the boxer. But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commune who took up Mr. Carter's cause and all but eliminating his courageous co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring (Holden).    ''MISSION TO MARS,'' starring Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins. Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113 minutes). This film's visual design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian surface look so real that the picture could have been made on location. But the movie is undermined by Mr. De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Mr. Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell).    ''THE NEXT BEST THING,'' starring Rupert Everett and Madonna. Directed by John Schlesinger (PG-13, 107 minutes). A contemporary screwball comedy about a Los Angeles yoga teacher (Madonna) and her gay best friend (Mr. Everett) who have a baby together, ''The Next Best Thing'' intermittently fizzes in its early scenes. But once it gets serious, the movie turns into a stumbling, poor man's ''Kramer vs. Kramer.'' Madonna is a curt, cool cookie whose painfully flat performance is all but devoid of feeling. Mr. Everett has a few bright comic moments as a man who discovers the joys of fatherhood (Holden).    ''THE NINTH GATE,'' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella. Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' then look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Mr. Langella is Boris Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired antiquities, who hires Dean Corso (Mr. Depp), a weedy rogue book dealer, to locate a volume called ''The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan get Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book? Mr. Polanski is out to cross ''Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof ''The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ''The Blair Witch Project,'' and not nearly as funny (Mitchell).    * ''NOT ONE LESS,'' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title), sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive power of Vittorio De Sica's ''Bicycle Thief'' (Scott).    * ''REINDEER GAMES,'' starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Charlize Theron. Directed by John Frankenheimer (R, 99 minutes). This is a wheel-within-a-wheel thriller that's a lot of fun until, near the end, it becomes a Xerox copy of a blueprint of a hit. Mr. Affleck, who suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent -- he wants to keep his light under a bushel, but he's not quite up to it -- plays Rudy, an ex-con who gets dragged into a casino heist planned for the Christmas season. Ms. Theron is the girl who lures him into the job. The seamy kicks of one double cross after another keep the movie in motion, and Mr. Frankenheimer's ruthless precision keeps it on track (Mitchell).    * ''SCREAM 3,'' starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this point it goes without saying that the ''Scream'' movies are like episodes of ''Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ''Scream 3'' belongs on the Cartoon Network, but this time for a better reason: The film is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to the spine. Mr. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films ''The Blair Witch Project'' and ''The Sixth Sense'' but rather ''Scream'' itself. ''Scream 3'' doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).    * ''TOPSY-TURVY,'' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Mr. Leigh's grandly entertaining ''Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as ''Shakespeare in Love'' did. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).    ''THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,'' starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. Directed by Jonathan Lynn (R, 100 minutes). Oz (Mr. Perry) is a nice-guy dentist beaten down by his bored wife. When the confident Jimmy (Mr. Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in motion. But it is missing the verve of someone who can take a simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a sleepwalker. Despite Mr. Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous gunplay that account for the second half of the movie, ''Yards'' is underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts (Mitchell).    * ''WINTER SLEEPERS,'' starring Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem, Floriane Daniel and Heino Ferch. Directed by Tom Tykwer (not rated, 124 minutes). Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ''Run Lola Run'' put Mr. Tykwer on the short list of major international filmmakers, ''Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise afflicting the generation now in its late 20's and 30's. But like ''Run Lola Run,'' the movie is also about how human destiny has everything to do with split-second timing (Holden).    ''WONDER BOYS,'' starring Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand and Tobey Maguire. Directed by Curtis Hanson (R, 112 minutes). This film boasts a first-rate cast, a credible literary source and a director whose last film, ''L.A. Confidential,'' showed a prodigious ability to capture the headlong rhythms of a complex plot and the particularities of a motley assortment of characters. But even with so much going for it, this adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel about a pot-smoking middle-aged novelist burdened by romantic and creative problems is flat and unconvincing. There's no shortage of screwball material: a dead dog, an errant tuba and a very tall drag queen, for starters. But Mr. Hanson, perhaps aiming for wry understatement, has smothered whatever antic rhythm the story might have had. Despite a brilliant supporting turn by Robert Downey Jr. as a gay book editor, ''Wonder Boys'' is like a George Cukor movie with a bad head cold: slow, muffled and vague (Scott).

Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).    ''THE BEACH,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle. Directed by Danny Boyle (R, 120 minutes). Mr. DiCaprio plays Richard, a young American vacationing in Thailand who is given a map that leads him to an island paradise. All of Mr. DiCaprio's charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the fact that there's not much going on here. While Mr. DiCaprio shows some talent, the movie is simply a Colors by Benetton take on ''Lord of the Flies,'' with the imperious paradise ruler (Ms. Swinton) holding court as the Promised Land crashes around her. Richard finds himself living the aphorism that has ruined the life of so many film protagonists: paradise breeds callousness, a marginal rethinking of beware of the things you want, for you shall have them (Elvis Mitchell).", "print_page": "26", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "MOVIE GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "MOVIE GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2000-02-18T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/49bae7db-fe67-5724-bd2f-122df7232cf5", "word_count": 2099, "uri": "nyt://article/49bae7db-fe67-5724-bd2f-122df7232cf5"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/17/movies/movie-guide.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series.

Now Playing    * ''ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women; Mr. Almodovar has aptly described his material as ''screwball drama.'' Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).    * ''AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch.

It contrasts her designs for commercial fabrics, which emphasized structure and materials in new ways, with her pictorially striking handloomed pieces. A gallery of photographs, letters, personal memorabilia and pre-Columbian textile fragments she collected reflects her character and quietly glamorous personal style.

Anderson is 46 and worth almost a billion dollars. He lives in Washington -- the city he grew up in, a city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it, ''personal'' -- in an apartment adorned with a painting he commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, ''I am still just a rat in a cage.'' ''That's what we are,'' Anderson explains, ''rats in a cage. And we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a 30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out.'' The cage Anderson refers to is the planet earth itself, and he has taken it upon himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to finance the International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to found the Space Frontier Foundation; in 1994, $5 million to start the Foundation for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and between 1996 and 1999, $40 million to build the Roton, a manned, reusable spaceship. Then a few months ago, in one of his eriodic calls to me, he rang me up: ''I'm in Russia!'' Anderson was midway through three days of talks with Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging for a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir.", "abstract": "Elizabeth Weil article on Walter Anderson, an American multimillionaire, and his plans for leasing the Russian space station Mir, rehabilitating it, expanding its volume and selling joy rides to individuals and advertising to commercial companies; NASA is unhappy with project because it threatens to prolong Russia's involvement with Mir and prevent it from keeping its commitments to International Space Station; cartoon (L)", "print_page": "37", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "American Megamillionaire Gets Russki Space Heap!", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "American Megamillionaire Gets Russki Space Heap!", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Russia", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Mircorp", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Space", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Space Stations", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIR (SPACE STATION)", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "International Space Cooperation and Ventures", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "International Space Station", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2000-07-23T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "byline": {"original": "By Elizabeth Weil", "person": [{"firstname": "Elizabeth", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Weil", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/f47756fe-2254-5b3e-8e77-a015bf2dd814", "word_count": 4537, "uri": "nyt://article/f47756fe-2254-5b3e-8e77-a015bf2dd814"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/business/excerpts-from-microsoft-s-response-to-plan-to-break-up-company.html", "snippet": "Excerpts from documents filed in Federal District Court in Washington by Microsoft Corp in response to proposal by government to split company in two", "lead_paragraph": "Following are excerpts from documents filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Washington by the Microsoft Corporation in response to last month's proposal by the government to split the company in two:", "abstract": "Excerpts from documents filed in Federal District Court in Washington by Microsoft Corp in response to proposal by government to split company in two", "print_page": "6", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Excerpts From Microsoft's Response to Plan to Break Up Company", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Excerpts From Microsoft's Response to Plan to Break Up Company", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Justice Department", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Microsoft Corp", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "States (US)", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER SOFTWARE", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND LAWS", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Suits and Litigation", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Attorneys General", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Computers and the Internet", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2000-05-11T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Text", "_id": "nyt://article/32d9dd7c-b057-5a62-9da9-d20572cf75d4", "word_count": 4127, "uri": "nyt://article/32d9dd7c-b057-5a62-9da9-d20572cf75d4"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/11/arts/spare-times-763586.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "ATTRACTIONS", "abstract": " ATTRACTIONS    Museums and Sites    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF THE MOVING IMAGE, 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue, Astoria, Queens.

Museums    ''THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, PART 2: 1950-2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 13). Filling the museum's six floors, this complicated, conflicted exhibition once more demonstrates the difficulty of mounting sweepingly inclusive exhibitions with no discernible point of view. It displays hundreds of works in dozens of mediums expertly placed in contexts that constantly pull one's attention outward, toward the show's flickering edges: landmark events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books, emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even the ephemeral. But these do not disguise a discouragingly conventional core and the predictable, severely truncated story told by the objects on view. The many great works in the show's first half tend to be overly familiar because they are mostly drawn from the museum's collection. Moving toward the present, the works become weaker, the choices of artists arbitrary, the sense of history increasingly confused and the absence of non-American artists more and more glaring. Ultimately one senses not an ''American Century'' or even half-century but two decades, the 1950's and 60's, during which American art -- seen in isolation -- held its ground.

Museums    * ''BERLIN METROPOLIS: JEWS AND THE NEW CULTURE, 1890-1918,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through April 23). A show that should be a required course in every New Yorker's education: our cosmopolitan tradition, our appetite for novelty and change spring partly from seeds planted a century ago in Berlin. Though it highlights the part played by Jews, the story it tells could be the story of all outsiders who gravitate toward cities in search of meaning. With more than 200 paintings, stage designs, sheet-music covers, gallery catalogs, photographs, sculptures and other objects, it covers the years when modernism took root: in galleries, publishing houses and theaters, in advanced art from France and Italy, in the rich street life of newspapers, cafes and shop windows. Given the revolutionary temper of the art, the presentation is surprisingly understated, and this adds enormously to the show's power. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Tuesdays until 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp).", "print_page": "48", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "ART GUIDE", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "ART GUIDE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2000-01-14T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Leisure/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Schedule", "_id": "nyt://article/c1f60010-452d-522b-b855-38f9e1bc3f53", "word_count": 4221, "uri": "nyt://article/c1f60010-452d-522b-b855-38f9e1bc3f53"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/15/business/mortgaged-lives-special-report-profiting-fine-print-with-wall-street-s-help.html", "snippet": "Special report, Mortgaged Lives, notes that scores of consumers have complained to state regulators about First Alliance Corp, national home-equity lender based in Irvine, Calif; over dozen homeowners have already sued; they assert that company ha...", "lead_paragraph": "Bernae Gunderson, a certified paralegal who lives in St. Paul, is not intimidated by fine print.
