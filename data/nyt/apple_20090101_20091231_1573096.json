Apple has also upgraded the MacPro tower and the iMac line, which now offers a 24-inch display at the same price, $1,499 as the older 20-inch model. (The 20-inch remains, and now costs $1,199.)  With a starting price of $599, the Mini is deeply indebted to the parts bin at Apple: As with the revamped aluminum-body MacBooks released last fall, the new Mini has an Intel 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo chip and an Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics card. There's a slot-loading optical drive/burner, and \u2014 probably because the Mini has no monitor built-in and needs to be more flexible \u2014 Apple has put in a Mini-DVI video connector, as well as the new Mini DisplayPort (sorry about all those \"mini\"s). Wireless and Bluetooth come along as well.  What's also new is five -- count 'em, five -- U.S.B. connections packed onto the back panel of the Mini. Either Apple wants to put the U.S.B. hub-makers out of business, or it's convinced that more is much better, U.S.B. port-wise.  The mini steps up to $799 if you opt to increase its hard-drive size from 120 gigabytes to 360, and double the memory to two gigabytes. As for being green, Apple claims the computer is super-efficient, using 45 percent less power at idle than its predecessor. My solution for saving energy at idle: shut down the computer.  As for the new 24-inch iMac at $1,499\u2026well, it's a deal-maker, I think, for those seeking an all-in-one, out-of-the-box computer (there's also the loss-leader 20-inch iMac at $1,199, and the iMac range tops out at $2,199 with all the bells and whistles). Details on the new desktops are here.  All the new Macs include the current OS, Leopard, as well as the inventive iLife '09 suite of software, including the revamped iPhoto app that my colleague Rik Fairlie wrote about in Gadgetwise a few weeks ago.  Today's announcements, along with last week's unveiling of the new Safari 4 Web browser and tweaks to the MacBook and MacPro notebook lines, pretty much complete the Macintosh upgrades across the board. What to watch for next: a smaller iPhone 3G, a new iPod to replace the classic. And the new operating system, Snow Leopard.

You can also purchase iLife for $79.   The biggest update to iPhoto is its ability to organize photos according to who is in them (Faces) and where they were taken (Places). Both work pretty well, and they're fun and snap-simple to use.   First, Faces. Faces scans your iPhoto library to identify photos with (human) faces and then searches for patterns in the faces. Next, you tag a face with a name, and the software searches for matches. It then asks you to verify the matches with a click (or two clicks to indicate a miss), and it will then repeat the process to build the library of faces. The library can then be searched by name or browsed using the new Faces view.  Faces works well, but not perfectly. I got a lot of matches for people whom I photograph often, but Faces by no means identified all photos of each person. And because software scans all images in which it recognizes a face, you'll get some pretty random faces. For instance, I have a couple of photos that include a Vatican tour guide. The software recorded her face and sometimes suggested her as a match for people I know.   Next, Places. Places automatically imports photo location data from a GPS-enabled camera or any iPhone photo (the iPhone records latitude and longitude). If you don't have a GPS-enabled digital camera, you can manually assign a location to any photo or group of photos. Places lets you type in a generic location, like New York City, or use Google Maps to pinpoint a location. For instance, you can assign photos to locations as precise as your backyard rather than your front yard.   Once iPhoto has plotted the photos, you can browse by an interactive global map. Places is a very cool tool for viewing vacation photos, and will become more useful as more cameras include built-in GPS capabilities.   In addition to Faces and Places, Apple added two new photo-editing capabilities that are worth mentioning. The first enables you to adjust saturation in images without affecting the skin color of your subjects (no more orange faces!). For instance, if you need to saturate a blown-out sky, you can do so without saturating the faces in the image. The new saturation feature is automatically enabled when the photo editor recognizes a face.   The feature I like best is Shadow. Everyone has taken photo in which the subject is in shadow, thanks to bright backlighting.

"(Photo: )   Apple adds some pretty clever tricks to its updated iPhoto application, available on new Macs as a part of the iLife '09 suite, which also includes iMovie, GarageBand and iWeb. You can also purchase iLife for $79.   The biggest update to iPhoto is its ability to organize photos according to who is in them (Faces) and where they were taken (Places). Both work pretty well, and they're fun and snap-simple to use.   First, Faces. Faces scans your iPhoto library to identify photos with (human) faces and then searches for patterns in the faces. Next, you tag a face with a name, and the software searches for matches. It then asks you to verify the matches with a click (or two clicks to indicate a miss), and it will then repeat the process to build the library of faces. The library can then be searched by name or browsed using the new Faces view.  Faces works well, but not perfectly. I got a lot of matches for people whom I photograph often, but Faces by no means identified all photos of each person. And because software scans all images in which it recognizes a face, you'll get some pretty random faces. For instance, I have a couple of photos that include a Vatican tour guide. The software recorded her face and sometimes suggested her as a match for people I know.   Next, Places. Places automatically imports photo location data from a GPS-enabled camera or any iPhone photo (the iPhone records latitude and longitude). If you don't have a GPS-enabled digital camera, you can manually assign a location to any photo or group of photos. Places lets you type in a generic location, like New York City, or use Google Maps to pinpoint a location. For instance, you can assign photos to locations as precise as your backyard rather than your front yard.   Once iPhoto has plotted the photos, you can browse by an interactive global map. Places is a very cool tool for viewing vacation photos, and will become more useful as more cameras include built-in GPS capabilities.   In addition to Faces and Places, Apple added two new photo-editing capabilities that are worth mentioning. The first enables you to adjust saturation in images without affecting the skin color of your subjects (no more orange faces!). For instance, if you need to saturate a blown-out sky, you can do so without saturating the faces in the image. The new saturation feature is automatically enabled when the photo editor recognizes a face.   The feature I like best is Shadow. Everyone has taken photo in which the subject is in shadow, thanks to bright backlighting. The Shadows feature corrects this remarkably well, and lets you adjust, via a slider, the level of brightening you prefer.   The iLife package is expensive at $79, but it also has some nice additions to iMovie and GarageBand. And if you've purchased a new Mac since Jan. 6, you can get an upgrade for $9.95.

Hong/Associated Press   Apple does its own thing when it comes to trade shows and press events. But the CTIA, the wireless industry trade group, is making an overture to Apple to attend its conference and trade show next year. The lure: an app extravaganza.  CTIA officials said last week that they were planning a big push at next year's show to celebrate applications. They've gotten commitments from Google to do a booth focused on apps for the Android phone, and from Research In Motion to do a booth focused on the BlackBerry app store.  \"Hopefully, we'll get Apple too,\" said Robert B. Mesirow, head of show operations for CTIA. He said CTIA was negotiating with Apple and described the chances of a partnership as \"50-50.\"   Mr. Mesirow described the apps plan for next year as a \"show within a show.\" The inspiration for that emphasis is clear. If there was a single word to describe this year's show, it was apps. Phone carriers and handset makers see games, navigation tools, video and other applications as a way to spur growth in an industry that has seen growth rates decline as the market has become saturated by coverage and devices.

This humble video-editing program from Apple, in its way, launched my entire career of making weekly goofball tech videos. For three years, I made them all by myself, on the cheap, with a camcorder and iMovie.  (Then, in 2007, CNBC offered to film and edit them for me. And put the results on TV. And pay me. I know--life's rough.)  No wonder, then, that I was so aghast when Apple replaced my beloved iMovie with something called iMovie '08. As I wrote in my review: \"It's nothing like its predecessor and contains none of the same code or design. It's incapable of the more sophisticated editing that the old iMovie made so enjoyable.  \"You can't manually adjust audio levels during a scene (for example, to make the music quieter when someone is speaking). You can't extract the audio from a clip. All the old audio effects are gone, too. No pitch changing, high-pass and low-pass filters, or reverb.  \"The new iMovie doesn't accept plug-ins, either. You can't add chapter markers for use in iDVD, which is supposed to be integrated with iMovie. Bookmarks are gone. 'Themes' are gone. All visual effects are gone--even basic options like slow motion, reverse motion, fast motion, and black-and-white. Incredibly, the new iMovie can't even convert older iMovie projects. All you can import is the clips themselves. None of your transitions, titles, credits, music, or special effects are preserved.\"  And so on.  Apple has spent the last year licking its wounds and propping up this iMovie impostor. The new version, iMovie '09, is far more usable.  If you're scoring at home, here are the features that have been restored: themes, extracting audio, chapter markers, direct export to iDVD, visual effects (including slo-mo, reverse motion, black-and-white and more).   Here's what's still missing: plug-ins, audio effects, manual audio adjustments, bookmarks, importing old iMovie projects without losing all your enhancements. [Update 6:20 pm: Actually, there are bookmarks now. They're just hidden until you turn on Advanced Tools in Preferences.]  That tally isn't exactly fair, however, because it doesn't consider all the things the new iMovie does that the old one couldn't. For example, its various skimming and scene-grabbing tools make it very quick to excerpt the best parts of your raw footage, and you never wait for anything to \"render\" in iMovie '09; any effect, transition, color adjustment or title you apply takes effect instantly.  A new pop-up menu appears when you drag one clip onto another one, offering options like Cutaway, Insert, Audio Only, Picture in Picture and Green Screen--by far the simplest presentation of these advanced features you'll see in a video editor. There are a handful of nice-looking, canned \"themes\" that let you open and close your movie with pro-looking graphics, and an excellent map feature that draws an animated line to show the course of your travels (\u00e0 la Indiana Jones).  There's a wicked-cool feature that lets you tap along to music--every beat, or at any spastic intervals you want--and then drop video clips onto those markers, so that the video cuts happen right in time to the music (or to your taps). Fast and easy.  The killer app, though, is image stabilization. It takes a long time to apply to a clip--several minutes each--but it winds up making jerky footage smooth, even if you were filming while hiccuping on a camel ride during an earthquake. You control the degree of smoothness; that's lucky, since 100 percent steady looks almost freakishly unnatural.  This feature works fantastically well--so much, in fact, that it's ruined everyone else's videos for me. Now, every time I see a handheld camera shot--on YouTube, on the news, in a documentary, I struggle to suppress the instinct to mentally apply iMovie stabilization to it. I just can't overstate what a revelation this feature is--and how much more watchable your home movies become.  The new iMovie offers so many satisfying time-savers that I would embrace it wholeheartedly, if it weren't still missing one critical option.  See, the world is moving to hi-def camcorders. And iMovie '09 works great with hi-def camcorders. But what if you want to show your edited movie on a high-definition TV?  You can't!  You can upload it to YouTube (at diminished quality), export it to a DVD (at diminished quality), or send it to your Apple TV, iPhone or iPod (at diminished quality).  In the days of olde iMovie, you could export the results back to your tape camcorder. You'd preserve 100 percent quality, you'd free up the space on your hard drive, ready for the next editing project, and you'd have a simple way to play the movies on your HDTV.  Apple, however, is convinced that tape camcorders are dead, and it seems determined to pound nails into that coffin. The company expects you to store all of your video, now and forever, on hard drives. (The 100 MiniDV tapes currently in my cabinet, for example, would require about 1.5 terabytes of hard drive space--double that if I want a backup.)  No Macs have Blu-ray burners, and iMovie lacks an Export to Tape command, so your high-def masterpieces are pretty much trapped forever on your Mac. (Sure, you could post them online, but only if they're short, and only if everyone in your potential audience has very high-speed Internet.)  Otherwise, if you've been terrified by the quivering disaster that was iMovie '08, you can come out hiding now; it won't bite. It requires a lot of relearning, but there's a lot of joy along the way.  Especially for the hard-drive industry.

Change is hard. So today might be a difficult day for some music lovers. The country's largest music retailer, Apple, is finally flipping the switch on what it calls \"variable pricing\" and on what the music industry calls the last, best hope to turn around its rapidly declining fortunes.  That single, comforting price of 99 cents for all songs in the iTunes music store is being replaced today by three pricing tiers: 69 cents for the oldies-but-not-so-goodies, $1.29 for some hot new hits, and 99 cents for nearly everything else. Apple is setting the prices based on the wholesale prices set by the music labels.  Apple described the changes in January at Macworld, but today we have the first specific indications of how the music labels will approach the new tiers. Here's a quick first look. Thirty-three of the top 100 songs now sell at $1.29 -- and the rest at 99 cents.  Sony BMG has priced the recent Pink single \"So What\" and the elegantly titled Kelly Clarkson single, \"My Life Would Suck Without You,\" at $1.29.   Universal Records' Interscope label has priced the new Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga and Soulja Boy songs at $1.29 as well. Warner has songs from the country crooners Zac Brown Band at the higher tier as well.  But songs from Disney's Miley Cyrus and EMI's Coldplay and Katy Perry, all popular artists, remain at 99 cents.  The new pricing was a result of sometime rancorous negotiations between Apple and the music labels. The Times reported in February that Apple agreed to the studios' demands for variable pricing only in exchange for allowing iPhone owners to buy songs over the 3G network, and for dropping the copyright protections known as digital rights management on digital music files.  Today Apple is also completing that transition. The 10 million tracks in the iTunes store are now finally free of Apple's proprietary Fairplay DRM, which restricted iTunes customers to playing protected songs only on their computers or on Apple devices like the iPod and iPhone. All the songs in the iTunes library are now encoded in what Apple is calling iTunes Plus, which is a verison of its AAC format encoded at a higher bit rate. Users can now freely swap songs among their computers and transfer them onto any device, including a mobile phone.   The changes come as the NPD Group reports that Amazon has achieved a small beachhead in the legal digital music market, with a 16 percent market share. Some rivals, like eMusic, and music industry analysts have suggested the higher prices come at a particularly bad time for the newly frugal American consumer, who had grown quite accustomed to 99-cent purchases. Amazon might now increase its share, since it now sells many of the same hits for a lower price.  So let's ask Bits readers to settle this: are you now more or less likely to buy music from iTunes?  Update: Apple points to some oldies-but-goodies that are indeed priced at 69 cents, including songs from Elvis Presley and Bruce Springsteen. Note: this link will open iTunes on your desktop.

Fizzy pints of virtual beer, lightsaber simulators and ancient flutelike instruments all have one thing in common: They're flying off the digital shelves of Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch.  And so is nearly everything else. On Friday, Apple unveiled a Web page dedicated to tracking the number of downloads for the iPhone and iPod Touch until the company hits a billion downloads. Just four months ago, in January, the company announced it had surpassed 500 million downloads.   Currently, the counter has about 70 million or so downloads to go until it hits the one billion milestone, but the popularity of mobile applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch has only been increasing since the company began allowing third-party developers to sell programs in the online market in July. By comparison, it took more than two years for Apple to announce the sale of its billionth song through iTunes.   In addition to the app ticker, Apple released lists of the top 20 most downloaded paid and free applications. Most of the top-ranking applications were created by professional companies, like Vivendi, Pandora and Electronic Arts, but several independent developers like Ethan Nicholas, who found success with the artillery game called iShoot, made it onto the list.   Koi Pond, an application that turns the screen of the iPhone and iPod Touch into a virtual aquarium, was listed as the second-most-downloaded paid application. Andy Skirvin, one of the developers behind the application, said he was \"shocked and surprised\" the game had done so well since it was released last summer.  \"I didn't think it could measure up to the bigger apps,\" Mr. Skirvin said in a phone interview. \"But it was priced so low that I guess it was a great impulse buy for people.\"   Mr. Skirvin is a co-founder of the Blimp Pilots, a small game company. By day, Mr. Skirvin is a video game developer for a start-up in San Diego; his credits include working on Everquest, a massively multiplayer game from Sony.   In late January, the Blimp Pilots released another game into the App Store called Distant Shore, which doubles as a sort of informal social network. Players stroll along the shores of a beach looking for seashells and washed-up bottles, which contain messages from other players.   The game hasn't taken off like Koi Pond, which Mr. Skirvin estimates has been downloaded around 900,000 times. But he's content with his team's success. \"This is just a side project for us outside of our day jobs,\" Mr. Skirvin said.

Steve Jobs, usually the looming presence over this four-day Mac/iPod/iPhone confab in San Francisco, was completely absent. Apple had a toned-down presence, and everybody knew that next year, the company won't be here at all, which made everyone wonder how long the event can survive.   What the media wants to see is the annual Steve Jobs keynote speech, where Apple's latest products are often unveiled. So: no press throngs next year. The software companies in those hundreds of booths want to be near the mother ship, to bask in its glory and be seen by its admirers. So: fewer booths next year. And the regular Apple fans want to see that keynote, try out those Apple products and explore those booths. So: fewer attendees.  The Expo will certainly take place next year\u2014many exhibitors have already committed to return\u2014and maybe all the training classes, social events and entertainment of the Expo will be enough to keep the event going for years, in some form. Otherwise, nobody knows.  So how was Apple's final keynote presentation, given by marketing executive Phil Schiller? Since everyone's expectations for hot new announcements were about zero, it's safe to say that the keynote pretty much fulfilled expectations.   There were no new category-busting products, no shockers. But there were some smaller, evolutionary gems. Here were three of my favorites.  First: an updated iPhoto (a picture organizing/editing/sharing program). Like Google's Picasa (originally for Windows, now for Mac, too), iPhoto offers face recognition. But iPhoto actually knows *whose* faces are in your photos\u2014and can automatically group your photos by the subjects in them.  It's not 100 percent accurate, of course; you're supposed to guide its artificial intelligence by clicking photos (to say \"you guessed right\u2014that's mom\") or double-clicking them (\"you guessed wrong\u2014that's not mom\"). But having iPhoto auto-create a folder full of son photos or wife photos or grandma photos would be plenty handy.  Second: an updated iMovie '09. Now, longtime readers may recall that I absolutely hated iMovie '08. It wasn't iMovie at all; Apple completely junked the beloved iMovie that had served it well for years, and replaced it with something completely unrecognizable, riddled with feature holes.  Some of those holes are filled in the new version (video effects, slow/fast motion, direct export to iDVD) and some aren't (no export back to tape, no volume-level \"rubber banding\"). Overall, though, iMovie '09 appears to be vastly more usable and complete than iMovie '08 was. Especially when you consider its killer new feature: software stabilization.  This program can do an insanely great job of turning a bouncy, jerky handheld camcorder shot into something smooth and level (following a long period of analysis; let it run unattended while you go get lunch). I tried it on about five different clips, some of which were VERY unsteady. It works so well, a couple of observers complained that it looked unnatural; the floaty SteadiCam feeling is so noticeable, it doesn't look like home movies anymore. No big deal; you can double-click a stabilized clip to open up an intensity slider that you can adjust to back off the effect.  In general, this feature could do wonders for the great majority of amateur videos.  I wasn't able to try either iPhoto or iMovie with my own picture and videos\u2014the software won't be ready until the end of the month. But they sure look juicy.  Third cool thing: Apple is removing the copy protection from every single song on the iTunes store. You'll soon be able to copy your songs freely from computer to computer to TiVo to Sonos player to non-iPod player, without ever having to worry about authorizing computers, entering passwords and so on.  Apple convinced the record companies to agree to this arrangement, but there was a price: iTunes has lost its simple 99-cents-a-song pricing. The record companies want to charge more for popular songs ($1.29), the same old price for medium-hot songs (99 cents), and less for oldy moldies to help wring some sales out of them (69 cents). The new pricing structure could help some people, and hurt others.  I spoke with Phil Schiller after his talk. I asked him if he could be any more specific about why Apple pulled out of the Macworld Expo\u2014to the heartbreak of the Mac faithful who have loved making the pilgrimage to this event for 25 years.  He said what the Apple press release said\u2014that Apple stores introduce more people to Apple's products in a week than 100 Macworld Expos. Trade shows just aren't worth the effort and the money. But he also pointed out that having to come up with another dazzling show every January\u2014a huge production, starring knock-'em-dead new products every year\u2014was unsustainable. He noted that Apple marches to certain annual product cycles: the holiday season (Novemberish), the educational buying season (late summer), the iPod product cycle (October), the iLife development cycle (usually March), the iPhone cycle (June). January doesn't fit ANY of them.   Today, I'm off to Las Vegas for CES, the Consumer Exhaustion Show. More to come!

(Deb Gardner)) Deb Gardner came up with a pear soup inspired by a classic salad. --MB  The average American eats 18 pounds of apples per year, but only three and a half pounds of pears. A shame, because pears are sublime in their subtlety.  Don't get me wrong; I love apples. I live in Washington, a state known for its apple production, although most are supermarket varieties that end up shipped abroad. I was ecstatic when I discovered Jones Creek Orchard, a tiny farm that produces more than 200 varieties of heirloom apples, just a few hours north of Seattle in the Skagit Valley. They grow apples with hot pink flesh, apples that taste like butterscotch, and apples that were popular in Shakespeare's time. Luckily for me, they also grow a few varieties of pears.  For the past few weeks, the Jones Creek stand at our farmers' market has had an unusual variety of Comice pear, with smooth, juicy white flesh and dark brown, russeted skin. I inhale them raw, but occasionally some of them survive long enough in my kitchen for use in cooking or baking.   Pears in desserts are fantastic. Raw or cooked, pears pair well (sorry) with almond extract, cream, dried cherries, wine, cinnamon or ginger.  There's always the classic salad with Gorgonzola and pecans or hazelnuts, to which I sometimes add saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms. This season, though, I'm trying to expand my savory pear repertoire, so I decided to experiment with soup, drawing on the flavors of the classic pear salad.   The result: pear soup with chanterelles and mushroom broth, dotted with gorgonzola. It worked beautifully. The mushroom flavor and a pinch of saffron accented the pear flavor, but did not overpower it. I served the soup with golden beets for color contrast, although it would also go well with crusty sourdough bread and a green salad, or as its own course before roasted lamb.  While any flavorful, ripe pear would work for this soup, pears are not interchangeable. Like apples, they come in a staggering number of varieties (check out this set of illustrations from 1921 of the pears of New York State). Tiny Seckel pears. Buttery, white Doyennes. Red Bartletts. Unlike apples, most pear varieties are heirlooms, even the usual suspects in the supermarket.

The new music player is half the size of its predecessor, but ups the memory capacity to 4GB (about 1,000 songs).   The new Shuffle gets its small size, in part, from placing the controls on the headset cord, as opposed to on the iPod itself. Like all previous Shuffles, there's no display, but Apple has added VoiceOver, its new synthesized-speech feature, that tells you what song is playing, who is singing it or what playlists you have.

new market for paid content.", "lead_paragraph": " It may be no surprise that the best-selling computer book so far this year is \"iPhone: The Missing Manual,\" by my colleague David Pogue (O'Reilly, 2007).  But here is something that did surprise me: The most popular edition of this book isn't on paper or the PDF file that O'Reilly Media also sells. It is the downloadable application for the iPhone, according to Tim O'Reilly, the chief executive of O'Reilly Media.   Amid all the discussion of micropayments and other ways that the creators of news and other content can be paid for their work, the iTunes App store is shaping up to be a surprisingly viable way to sell all sorts of information and entertainment.   There is a lot more content of the sort you would have bought in the past but now you can get free on the Web: a directory of Congressional offices, standup comedy routines, gym workout videos, Zagat restaurant guides and a growing library of books. There is also a fair bit of free content, public-domain e-books like the complete works of Shakespeare and lots of advertising-supported media. (BusinessWeek has a report this week on the App store's role in music.)  What's most interesting is how iPhone users are willing to spend money in ways that Web users are not.   I've criticized Apple from time to time for not having a coherent approach to delivering free content with advertising. But in some ways, the development of a market for paid content is a bigger and less expected achievement.   Why has this happened? Apple has created an environment that makes buying digital goods easy and common. With an infrastructure that supports one-click purchases of songs and videos, it was easy to add applications in the same paradigm. Paying for software, especially games, is not new to Apple customers. So when you see the iPhone manual or the Frommer's Paris guidebook, it feels natural to click. (And of course, your credit card is already on file with Apple.)   There are certainly other precedents. Many people who steal songs through Limewire nonetheless pay $1.99 to use the same tunes as ringtones. And for avid book readers, Amazon's Kindle has found a market willing to pay for electronic books. Apple is also starting to sell subscriptions to bundles of music, video and images from certain bands, like Depeche Mode. This is technically a product of the Music store, not the App store, but it still shows how people may be willing to pay for various bundles of content online   There is a lot of work to do here. For example, I find the O'Reilly iPhone book a little hard to use. The text doesn't seem particularly well-formatted for the iPhone page. And I would love to see more interactive features that utilize the phone interface (including some of David's videos).   Andrew Savikas, O'Reilly's vice president for digital initiatives, agrees with me, saying that the iPhone manual was rushed to get it out before Christmas. The company now has 20 titles in development for the iPhone (and eventually other mobile phones), and it is spending more time weaving in hyperlinks and adding other features.   \"There is a lot more we can do to take advantage of this as a new medium,\" he said. O'Reilly, which sells to a lot of early adopters, has a range of digital distribution media.   \"We try to say all of our writing is writing for the Web, and all of our publishing is digital publishing, so all our focus is building things into the content that make it more friendly to be digital,\" he said.   Before media companies rejoice that Apple has found a way to persuade a generation used to getting everything free on the Web to pay for some content, they should look a bit more closely at O'Reilly's experience with the iPhone manual.   The book, which sells for $24.99, was initially offered as an iPhone app for $4.99. When the publisher raised the price to $9.99, sales fell 75 percent. O'Reilly quickly dropped the price back down to the lower level.   \"This audience is very price sensitive,\" Mr. Savikas said.   So even if all content doesn't have to be free, it may well have to be cheap.

Mr. Monroe helped lead the electronics development of the 200C's iQ Power touch-screen system, first introduced at this year's Detroit auto show.  The production-ready system was patented by the Nartron Corporation, which also owns the technology for the human-interface design used by other companies, including Apple. That may help explain the iPhone-inspired features behind iQ Power. \"It's what Apple did with the iPhone,\" said Norman Rautiola, Natron's chief executive.  Specifically, iQ Power lets drivers use any smartphone as a virtual key fob to control a host of functions, including locking and unlocking the vehicle's doors and trunk and rolling the windows up and down. With their smartphones, users can also access a live interior shot of the vehicle as well as check on the status of their home's security alarm, carbon dioxide and smoke detectors.     By touching and dragging a virtual trackball on the car's curved dashboard, the driver and front-seat passenger can also control the vehicle's music library, which replicates Apple's album art cover-flow feature. The media library moves with the phone, so users can customize and take their settings with them.  The passenger side of the 200C deploys a UConnect tablet so passengers can access the car's entertainment features and send recommendations to the driver. Passengers can also access the settings through a console-mounted passenger interface.  According to Mr. Rautiola, the 200C is expected to be released in 2012.

But what is really important aren't the consumer features, but new tools for developers, which could lead to a wave of advanced new uses for the iPhone.  Apple has given developers 1,000 new APIs, which stands for Application Programming Interface. That matters because APIs are the tools and mechanisms that software developers use to make their programs function.  Several are mainly to the benefit of the developers -\u2013 new tools that let them charge for subscription services. Or one that lets developers sell virtual items -\u2013 like special guns for shoot-em-up games or pretend swag for the Sims -\u2013 from within the game.  But there are two new functions of particular promise -\u2013 one will let two iPhones speak to each other, opening all kinds of possibilities to shared use (most obvious, head-to-head games).  More important, it is also giving developers tools so the iPhone can speak to other devices. \"They have opened the ability of the iPhone to speak directly to other hardware, so if you want the iPhone to talk to your car, it can,\" said Michael Gartenberg, a personal technology analyst for Interpret LLC.   To cite the example Apple demonstrated, an iPhone was connected to a blood glucose meter. The meter's results go to an app that helps diabetics test and track glucose levels, log what they eat, and calculate how much insulin to take. \"All of this would be difficult if not impossible on other phone operating systems,\" Mr. Gartenberg said.  Tantalizing stuff, although I am always a little leery of writing about a technology's potential. Reality often falls short. We could end up with hundreds of pay-to-play virtual whoopee cushions.

The new one looks like a sleek aluminum tie clip, or maybe a slightly elongated stick of Trident gum; a AA battery hides it completely. There's just enough room on the back for a mirror-finish spring clip for fastening to your clothes. (If you order from apple.com, you can get a custom message laser-etched onto the clip.)  (Photo:  iPod Shuffle) When I told someone that the Shuffle now holds 1,000 songs (in its 4 gigabytes of memory), he laughed. \"It's like a 'Saturday Night Live' skit about smaller and smaller iPods,\" he said. \"Or like the micro-cellphone in the movie 'Zoolander.'\"  And indeed it is. Apple says that it's the smallest music player on earth. Let's put it this way: it's really, really small.  It's so small, in fact, that there's no room for a screen, or even buttons or controls; it's just a tiny, sleek slab with pleasantly rounded corners.  Instead, Apple has put a tiny remote control right on the earbud cord. It has three clickable spots: + and \u2013 to control the volume, and a center button that acts as a play/pause button.   Yet incredibly, even though this Shuffle is even smaller than the previous one, it's actually more useful. No iPod Shuffle has ever had a screen, and therefore you've never been able to identify the song or band you're hearing. You've also never been able to work with playlists, since there's no user interface with which to navigate them.  Now there is. You can tell all this stuff not by looking, but by listening; according to Apple, the new Shuffle is the world's first talking music player, thanks to a new feature called VoiceOver.  (It's not the first, actually. Older iPods have had talking menus to help blind people. But anyway.)  If you hold down the center clicker for one second, you hear, in your earbuds, a crystal-clear male voice identifying the song and the performer; it knows 14 languages, so it can handle Italian aria names, for example. If you hold down the clicker longer, until you hear a beep, the voice starts rattling off the names of your playlists (\"Jogging Tunes\u2026Purchased\u2026Makeout Music.\") You click the clicker when he gets to the one you want, or use the + and \u2013 buttons to go forward or back through them.  You can also flip the power switch off and on again to hear him tell you how full your battery is\u2014for example, \"Battery 50 percent.\" Apple says that a single charge plays music for 10 hours.  It's looking like 2009 may be the year that synthesized voices go mainstream; this talking iPod comes hot on the heels of Amazon's Kindle 2, which can read your e-books aloud to you. In the Shuffle's case, this is an especially interesting development, because it means that the player itself can be out of sight. It can be clipped deep inside your clothes, for example, away from subway iPod thieves. Yet you can still operate and navigate your music using only the earbud clicker and feedback from Mr. VoiceOver.  You should know, however, that the voice you hear differs depending on whether you've loaded up the Shuffle from a Mac (clear, American, accent-free voice) or a Windows PC (much more synthesized-sounding, vaguely Scandinavian accent).   But hey\u2014all's fair in business, right? Microsoft has given the Mac universe slightly stunted versions of its programs for years; now, evidently, it's payback time.  Instead of the built-in USB connector of the original Shuffle, or the tiny plastic dock of the second-generation one, this third-generation Shuffle comes with a tiny, three-inch white USB cord. That's how you charge it, and that's how you load it up with music and podcasts from a copy of iTunes 8.1 (a required download before you can use the Shuffle on your Mac or PC).  Now, overall, new design is ingenious. The solid-slab-of-aluminum approach surely makes this the most rugged iPod ever. The sound is fantastic. And the price is right: The new Shuffle is available in black or silver aluminum for $80.   But the old, square Shuffle is still available (half the capacity, $70). And why would you want it?  Because the new Shuffle locks you into using Apple's earbuds. No other headphones have the clicker on the cord, and so can't make the music play music at all.   Personally, I'm in love with the Arriva.com headphones for the old Shuffle. It's a headband that goes around the back of your head, placing the earbuds neatly into your ears without any cords or tangling; the Shuffle itself clips into the middle, at the back of your head where you can easily reach it. The whole thing is inconspicuous, doesn't fall off and doesn't interfere with glasses\u2014and if you have long hair, you can listen to the iPod completely undetected (hello, PTA meetings!). The new Shuffle, however, wouldn't work with those headphones.  Apple says that it has been working with headset makers to help them design Shuffle-compatible headphones; announcements should be forthcoming shortly. For now, though, potential Shufflers should be aware that it's the included earbuds, Apple's $80 in-ear earbuds, or nothing.  As iPods' size approaches that of atomic particles, some online are pointing out that they're becoming ever more likely to get lost. I'm not convinced that that's an issue; that three-foot white strand of earbud cord makes a pretty good landmark when you're rooting through a purse or a drawer.   No, the only real cause for pause is that headphone-selection issue\u2014and whether you might prefer an iPod with a screen (which would give you photo and video playback, plus compatibility with the zillions of iPod chargers, car adapters, speaker docks and other accessories). But if you want really big sound in a really small package, the iPod Shuffle may be speaking your name.   P.S.--This Sunday morning, March 15, \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" plans to air my report on A Better Place. It's software millionaire Shai Agassi's audacious plan to solve the climate crisis and eliminate our dependence on oil. The crux: Replace all of the world's automobiles with electric cars that contain swappable batteries. Sound unattainable? Guess what: 5 countries, 3 American states, at least 2 car companies, and armies of investors (over $500 million so far) have already signed on to make it happen.  As always, the lineup may change, but this is the current broadcast plan. Set your TiVo!

Switching to an iPhone, I immediately noticed the difference. My office? Don't even -- I get nothing there. At home? Better, but not quite the same. And dead spots all over the place. At any time, I can (and do) lose a call.  But then I realized something. AT&T and Apple have given me a gift.  The promise of ubiquitous communication has also been its peril. With the iPhone, I have something that can cut out, that can drop a call, that can miss a voicemail. This is like gold in my hand: My ability to duck, shirk and hide has been restored.  \"What's that? You called me three times already? Sorry, man -- got an iPhone.\"  (That sound you just heard? That's the sound of freedom, baby. Glorious, dissembling freedom.)

Oh, right--that was me.  Anyway, there are now 15,000 programs available on the App Store, and so many more are flooding in that Apple's army of screeners can't even keep up. I keep meaning to write a thoughtful, thorough roundup of the very best of these amazing programs, but every day that I don't do it, the job becomes more daunting. (But don't worry. I'll get around to it.)  (Photo: ) For the moment, let's use a single program as a case study. It's one of the most magical programs I've ever seen for the iPhone, and probably for any computer. It's Ocarina, named after the ancient clay wind instrument.  Once you install and open this program, your iPhone's screen displays four colored circles of different sizes. These are the \"holes\" that you cover with your fingers, as you would the holes on a flute. Then you blow into the microphone hole at the bottom of the iPhone, and presto: the haunting, expressive, beautiful sound of a wind instrument comes from the iPhone speaker.   Different combinations of fingers on those four \"holes\" produce the different notes of the scale. (You can change the key in Preferences--no doubt a first on a cellphone.) Tilting the phone up or down controls the vibrato.  Ocarina has become a mega-hit. YouTube videos show people playing their favorite songs on this thing with amazing skill. (The \"Stairway to Heaven\" arrangement, featuring four people playing their iPhones in harmony, is especially memorable.) The software company's Web site, Smule.com, even includes sheet-music pages that show you how to play well-known songs on Ocarina.  Ocarina takes advantages of the iPhone's microphone, speaker, touch screen, graphics and tilt sensor. Incredibly, though, it also exploits the iPhone's Internet connection and GPS, as well.  If you tap the little globe at the bottom of the screen, the screen changes. Now you see a map of the world--and you start hearing the Ocarina performance of one person, in one city (indicated by animated sound waves on the map), who's playing the thing *right now*. Sometimes it's the halting fumbles of a rank beginner; sometimes it's a lovely melody played by someone who's got the hang of it. You can hit a Next button to tune in to another stranger, and another, all around the world.  It's a brain-frying experience to know that you're listening to someone else playing Ocarina, right now, in real time, somewhere else on the planet. (And then you realize that someone, somewhere might be listening to *you*!)  The best part of this story isn't just that someone has turned a cellphone, for crying out loud, into a musical instrument with fantastic expressive potential. It's that hundreds of thousands of people have bought this program in just a few months--for $1 apiece.  Apple, which runs the store, keeps 30 percent of each sale. Even so, Ocarina demonstrates that a programmer can make a staggering amount of money from the iPhone store. It's a crazy new software model that I don't remember seeing anywhere else. It's not a boxed software program for $600, or even a shareware program you download for $25. It's a buck a copy.  The beauty here is that at these prices, there's very little risk in trying something out. How many software programs have you bought for your Mac or PC? Two? Four? Well, the average iPhone owner may wind up installing 10, 20 or 30 programs. In all, according to Apple, iPhone owners have downloaded 500 million copies of these programs. Half a billion--since last July.  There's a lot of gloom in the tech industry (and every industry, for that matter). But even when the economy is crashing down around us, there's still amazing power in a single good idea.

Fortunately, some varsity-level troubleshooting can provide a fix.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo:  )   OK, this is going to be a really really geeky blog post, of interest only to a tiny number of video-editing types. But if it helps only one person out there well, then it really won't have been worthwhile. But still.  Remember when I wrote here, a couple of days ago, about how I attempted a \"three-camera shoot\" of my son's jazz-band concert? I used two hi-def Flip camcorders taped into place, plus a handheld Canon hi-def tape camcorder from my seat.  What I didn't tell you is how long it took me to edit the darned thing. Hours and hours. All week.  Final Cut, the editing software, was doing something I've never seen it do before: every time I adjusted a video clip's position in the timeline, the software had to \"render\" (process) that clip again, which meant my sitting there for several minutes until it was finished. (It never had to re-render the Flip clips-just the Canon clips.)  In the year I've been using Final Cut, I had never seen it do this; I figured it was related to my editing in high defintion.  But as the week wore on, I got so frustrated that I called Apple for tech support. I was advised to examine the file formats of my different clips. Turns out that the Flip clips came in the H.264 codec-and the Canon video was in the Apple Intermediate Codec (AIC). (Why? Because that's the format iMovie '09 creates when it imports hi-def video. I had used iMovie to import the Canon video because Final Cut, for some reason, could not \"see\" my camcorder.)  Final Cut conforms its timeline to the compression scheme of the *first* clip you drag into it-in this case, a Flip clip. That's why the Canon clips needed constant re-rendering; Final Cut had to keep converting them to the H.264 format for playback.  Now, it's easy to change the timeline format. I set it to AIC-and sure enough, I could now freely edit the Canon clips without ever waiting for re-rendering. Yay!  Except now the Flip clips had to re-render every time I touched them. Sigh.  The Apple guy suggested an ingenious solution: I could turn the Flip clips into AIC format behind Final Cut's back, without having to re-do their placement or editing.  He told me to right-click each of the two source Flip video clips (each 35 minutes long) and choose Make Offline. That detaches the video files on the hard drive from the Final Cut project.  Then, using QuickTime Player, I converted the two 35-minute Flip clips into the AIC format. Now the timeline, the Flip clips, and the Canon video would all have the same format. After that process, I did that right-clicking business and reconnected the converted offline Flip files.  My concern was that the Flip footage had been chopped up into hundreds of short, several-second clips, scattered all over the concert video-yet amazingly, when I reconnected the converted source files to my project, everything stayed exactly in place.  The only change, in fact, was that now, nothing needed rendering, ever!  I wound up finishing the project in about two hours. That work would have taken five times as long under the old scheme.  The Apple rep enjoyed troubleshooting this one. He explained that, in a way, I had come up with a bizarre between-two-worlds problem that most people never encounter: I had used the ultimate in cheap consumer cameras-those Flip camcorders-with the ultimate in high-end professional software.  I wish I'd discovered the incompatible-codec problem much, much earlier in the process-but I was thrilled to have solved it while there was still time to be saved.  OK, now I've got that off my chest. I'll return to less nerdy, jargony posts next week. ", "abstract": "When editing footage from two different camcorders, Final Cut gets a little kludgy.

Fortunately, some varsity-level troubleshooting can provide a fix.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo:  )   OK, this is going to be a really really geeky blog post, of interest only to a tiny number of video-editing types. But if it helps only one person out there well, then it really won't have been worthwhile. But still.  Remember when I wrote here, a couple of days ago, about how I attempted a \"three-camera shoot\" of my son's jazz-band concert? I used two hi-def Flip camcorders taped into place, plus a handheld Canon hi-def tape camcorder from my seat.  What I didn't tell you is how long it took me to edit the darned thing. Hours and hours. All week.  Final Cut, the editing software, was doing something I've never seen it do before: every time I adjusted a video clip's position in the timeline, the software had to \"render\" (process) that clip again, which meant my sitting there for several minutes until it was finished. (It never had to re-render the Flip clips-just the Canon clips.)  In the year I've been using Final Cut, I had never seen it do this; I figured it was related to my editing in high defintion.  But as the week wore on, I got so frustrated that I called Apple for tech support. I was advised to examine the file formats of my different clips. Turns out that the Flip clips came in the H.264 codec-and the Canon video was in the Apple Intermediate Codec (AIC). (Why? Because that's the format iMovie '09 creates when it imports hi-def video. I had used iMovie to import the Canon video because Final Cut, for some reason, could not \"see\" my camcorder.)  Final Cut conforms its timeline to the compression scheme of the *first* clip you drag into it-in this case, a Flip clip. That's why the Canon clips needed constant re-rendering; Final Cut had to keep converting them to the H.264 format for playback.  Now, it's easy to change the timeline format. I set it to AIC-and sure enough, I could now freely edit the Canon clips without ever waiting for re-rendering. Yay!  Except now the Flip clips had to re-render every time I touched them. Sigh.  The Apple guy suggested an ingenious solution: I could turn the Flip clips into AIC format behind Final Cut's back, without having to re-do their placement or editing.  He told me to right-click each of the two source Flip video clips (each 35 minutes long) and choose Make Offline. That detaches the video files on the hard drive from the Final Cut project.  Then, using QuickTime Player, I converted the two 35-minute Flip clips into the AIC format. Now the timeline, the Flip clips, and the Canon video would all have the same format. After that process, I did that right-clicking business and reconnected the converted offline Flip files.  My concern was that the Flip footage had been chopped up into hundreds of short, several-second clips, scattered all over the concert video-yet amazingly, when I reconnected the converted source files to my project, everything stayed exactly in place.  The only change, in fact, was that now, nothing needed rendering, ever!  I wound up finishing the project in about two hours. That work would have taken five times as long under the old scheme.  The Apple rep enjoyed troubleshooting this one. He explained that, in a way, I had come up with a bizarre between-two-worlds problem that most people never encounter: I had used the ultimate in cheap consumer cameras-those Flip camcorders-with the ultimate in high-end professional software.  I wish I'd discovered the incompatible-codec problem much, much earlier in the process-but I was thrilled to have solved it while there was still time to be saved.  OK, now I've got that off my chest. I'll return to less nerdy, jargony posts next week. ", "abstract": "When editing footage from two different camcorders, Final Cut gets a little kludgy.

If you spent your whole life watching movies and never ventured outside, you could be forgiven for thinking that it was the Mac OS, not Windows, that had the dominant PC market share.  Of course that's not the case, but given that perception can alter reality, Apple believes that the money it costs to place its computers in front of the moviegoing public could well pay off in increased sales.  And that's the strategy behind Sony's move to put its LCD TVs in front of virtually every eyeball in the new Dallas Cowboys stadium that's opening in June. The electronics maker announced on Sunday that it had installed more than 3,000 flat-panel TVs throughout the venue, in luxury suites, concourses, as digital menus at the concession areas and elsewhere.  In addition to showing the latest hot dog prices, the displays, which range in size from 17 to 70 inches, will feature specially created high-definition programming about the game, including replays, interviews and other content.   Next up: Sony Blu-ray players and PlayStation consoles in the suites, allowing fans who have had enough of the game to watch a movie or play a video game.  This is Sony's largest sports stadium installation. In strategy, it is similar to the company's recently announced move to equip all Muvico theaters with LCD menu boards and PlayStation consoles. The aim in both cases: to make the Sony name synonymous with television.   After an early miscalculation at the beginning of the shift to flat-panel TVs when the company was hurt by too little product, the company hopes it can make up for lost time by creating the impression that the only TVs worth buying are Sonys.

Does that mean I can play the files on other types of music players?  \"D.R.M.\" stands for digital-rights management, which is the copy-protection software built into many songs purchased from the iTunes Store; tracks labeled \"iTunes Plus\" are free of it. Songs with D.R.M. can only be played on a certain number of computers and have other specified limits for use.  But earlier this year at the Macworld Expo, Apple announced that it was making all of the music in its iTunes Store D.R.M.-free over the next few months, which means there are no software restrictions on what you can do with a purchased song.  D.R.M.-free songs from the iTunes Store should play on other music players besides iPods and iPhones. Tracks from the iTunes Store are in the A.A.C. (Advanced Audio Coding) format. If the non-Apple music player cannot play A.A.C. files, you will have to convert the tracks to MP3.   You can actually do this right in iTunes: go to the iTunes preferences (found under the Edit menu in the Windows version and under the Application menu on the Mac) and click on the General tab. Click on the Import Settings button and change the import format to MP3. Then, select a track you want to convert in the iTunes library, right-click on it and choose \"Create MP3 Version\" from the menu. This makes a duplicate version in the MP3 format.  Although the copy-restrictions are gone, copyright law is still in effect. And another thing to remember before sharing iTunes music with the world at large: the name and e-mail address from the iTunes Store account used to buy a song are embedded in the purchased song file itself. You can see the information by selecting the track and pressing Control-I (Command-I on the Mac) and clicking on the Summary tab.

Does that mean I can play the files on other types of music players?  \"D.R.M.\" stands for digital-rights management, which is the copy-protection software built into many songs purchased from the iTunes Store; tracks labeled \"iTunes Plus\" are free of it. Songs with D.R.M. can only be played on a certain number of computers and have other specified limits for use.  But earlier this year at the Macworld Expo, Apple announced that it was making all of the music in its iTunes Store D.R.M.-free over the next few months, which means there are no software restrictions on what you can do with a purchased song.  D.R.M.-free songs from the iTunes Store should play on other music players besides iPods and iPhones. Tracks from the iTunes Store are in the A.A.C. (Advanced Audio Coding) format. If the non-Apple music player cannot play A.A.C. files, you will have to convert the tracks to MP3.   You can actually do this right in iTunes: go to the iTunes preferences (found under the Edit menu in the Windows version and under the Application menu on the Mac) and click on the General tab. Click on the Import Settings button and change the import format to MP3. Then, select a track you want to convert in the iTunes library, right-click on it and choose \"Create MP3 Version\" from the menu. This makes a duplicate version in the MP3 format.  Although the copy-restrictions are gone, copyright law is still in effect. And another thing to remember before sharing iTunes music with the world at large: the name and e-mail address from the iTunes Store account used to buy a song are embedded in the purchased song file itself. You can see the information by selecting the track and pressing Control-I (Command-I on the Mac) and clicking on the Summary tab.

Odds are not quite as good, that you are, too. (About 31 percent of businesses are expected to give employees the day off.)   It is becoming traditional to commemorate Martin Luther King Day as a day of service, and this year the incoming President has particularly stressed that theme. So if you are home, and are looking for a way to better the world with your children, here are a few suggestions.   Examiner.com has culled a list of children's service events, all in the New York area:     Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Celebration_Jewish Community Center 334 Amsterdam Ave. (at 76th St) Upper West Side When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 11am\u20132pm   Description: Today is all about bettering the community with your tots. At the JCC, families can create welcome kits for children coming into hospitals as part of the Camp Sunshine project, as well as prepare meals that will be delivered to local shelters. To round out the event, kids can write letters to President-Elect Obama on the eve of the historic inauguration. All ages.  Children for Children: 7th Annual Grow Involved on MLK Jr. Day At 2 locations: Harlem / Wash. Heights 176 East 115th St. 122 Amsterdam Ave. When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 10am\u20132pm .  Description: Stop by either location between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to join thousands of children and adults in celebration of Dr. King's famous words, \"Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.\" Last year, more than 2,000 volunteers came together for this event and we look forward to another momentous day this year. Participants will have the chance to complete a wide variety of hands-on projects, benefiting many different New York City-based and international causes.  Green Apple Corps Seward Park, East Broadway and Essex St. in Lower East Side/Chinatown When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 9:00am\u20132:45pm; feel free to show up at any time   Description: Green Apple Corps will host a special Day of Service at Seward Park, to celebrate MLK's legacy and participate in urban environmental stewardship. Students and families are welcome to participate! Activities include street tree pit care, mulching and composting, nature tours around Seward Park, and environmental education with the Urban Park Rangers and Green Apple Corps.  Hundreds more possibilities, across the country, can be found on my.mlkday.gov and USAservice.org. Both sites turned up several dozen events within a 25 mile radius of my house.   Some schools, though not many businesses, are also closed for the inauguration tomorrow. Whether your children have school or not, you can celebrate history with them tonight, at the Kids Inaugural, which will be hosted by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden and feature Sasha and Malia's favorites \u2013 the Jonas Brothers \u2013 among others. You don't have to go to Washington (where there are no more tickets available.) You can watch it on the Disney Channel.   If you are looking for facts and folklore to go with your pop-singers, check out \"Our White House Inauguaration Celebration Kit!\" created by the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance. There you will find everything you might ever want to know about Inaugural history, on variety of school-age reading levels.  I have been hearing from parents in recent weeks who are considering taking their kids out of class, maybe just during lunchtime (or, on the West coast, for a late breakfast\u2026) so the family can watch the event, which starts at 11:30 EST, together. As it happens, my boys are off from school, for Superintendent's Day, and we'll be hanging on our couch together, which is where we found ourselves often this past year \u2013 watching Presidential debates, or waiting for primary, and then general, election night returns.

If you're not wearing green, it may be enough just to be green with envy\u2014for the iPhone software programmers who got access today to the beta version of the iPhone 3.0 software. Apple unveiled it in California today.   The rest of us will get the goodies in the form of a free software update this summer. With only a couple of technical exceptions, all of the new features will work on all iPhones and iPod Touches ever made, so nobody will be left behind. Nice.   And what are the new features?   * Cut, Copy, and Paste. Double-tap/drag some text to highlight it. A balloon offering Cut and Copy buttons appears at your fingertip. (Drag either end of the highlighted region to extend it.) Double-tap somewhere else\u2014even a different program\u2014to paste what you've copied. To undo a paste, just shake the iPhone.   * Big keyboard everywhere. Used to be, you could rotate the iPhone to landscape orientation, which made the keyboard keys much bigger and better spaced\u2014easier for typing\u2014but only in the Safari Web browser. Now you can get the big keyboard in all core iPhone programs: Notes, Mail, and so on.   * Bluetooth stereo audio. The iPhone can now play your music to so-called A2DP wireless Bluetooth headphones. They sound amazing. (Not available to first-generation iPhones.)   * MMS messaging. Now you can send pictures or audio clips to other cellphones, just as on any other mobile phone on earth. You can also send contacts from your address book (vCards), or your location information, in the same way. (Not available to first-generation iPhones.)   * Spotlight. There's a new search screen to the \"left\" of your first Home page (swipe your finger to see it). It lets you search your entire iPhone, including your list of programs\u2014and since you can open a program from the results list, it's now a speedy launcher. No more swiping through 9 screens full of icons just to find the one you want.   You can also search your address book, your e-mail stash (hurrah!), your iPod song and video lists, your calendar, and your notes.   * Audio recording and trimming. Record notes to self, interviews, and so on\u2014then edit and send to another cellphone, if you like.   * Subscribed calendars. The iPhone calendar can now subscribe to published shared calendars (like sports-league schedules) in CalDAV or .ics formats.    Another big category of enhancements aren't iPhone features per se, but are potential features available to iPhone software programmers. For example:   * Push notifications. The iPhone still can't run more than one program simultaneously (that feature kills battery life, says Apple). But at least now, chat programs (for example) can notify you when people are trying to contact you, even if those programs aren't running at the moment, thanks to \"push\" notifications.   * In-app purchases. Now you'll be able to buy new issues of a magazine, new e-books inside a reader program, additional game levels, and so on, right from within the program itself. You don't have to lumber off to the App Store to get them.   * Peer-to-peer recognition. iPhones can discover and connect to other iPhones nearby. Great for playing games against friends, or for shooting e-business cards to other people.   * Turn-by-turn directions. Programmers can now create GPS programs with turn-by-turn directions\u2014as long as they don't use Google's wonderful map information. Thanks to some dumb legal restrictions, they have to supply their own map data.   So basically, Apple seems to have addressed almost all of the chronic complaints about the iPhone's core features\u2014just in time for the arrival of the iPhone's first serious competition this summer. You gotta love competition, eh?

Odds are not quite as good, that you are, too. (About 31 percent of businesses are expected to give employees the day off.)   It is becoming traditional to commemorate Martin Luther King Day as a day of service, and this year the incoming President has particularly stressed that theme. So if you are home, and are looking for a way to better the world with your children, here are a few suggestions.   Examiner.com has culled a list of children's service events, all in the New York area:     Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Celebration_Jewish Community Center 334 Amsterdam Ave. (at 76th St) Upper West Side When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 11am\u20132pm   Description: Today is all about bettering the community with your tots. At the JCC, families can create welcome kits for children coming into hospitals as part of the Camp Sunshine project, as well as prepare meals that will be delivered to local shelters. To round out the event, kids can write letters to President-Elect Obama on the eve of the historic inauguration. All ages.  Children for Children: 7th Annual Grow Involved on MLK Jr. Day At 2 locations: Harlem / Wash. Heights 176 East 115th St. 122 Amsterdam Ave. When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 10am\u20132pm .  Description: Stop by either location between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to join thousands of children and adults in celebration of Dr. King's famous words, \"Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.\" Last year, more than 2,000 volunteers came together for this event and we look forward to another momentous day this year. Participants will have the chance to complete a wide variety of hands-on projects, benefiting many different New York City-based and international causes.  Green Apple Corps Seward Park, East Broadway and Essex St. in Lower East Side/Chinatown When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 9:00am\u20132:45pm; feel free to show up at any time   Description: Green Apple Corps will host a special Day of Service at Seward Park, to celebrate MLK's legacy and participate in urban environmental stewardship. Students and families are welcome to participate! Activities include street tree pit care, mulching and composting, nature tours around Seward Park, and environmental education with the Urban Park Rangers and Green Apple Corps.  Hundreds more possibilities, across the country, can be found on my.mlkday.gov and USAservice.org. Both sites turned up several dozen events within a 25 mile radius of my house.   Some schools, though not many businesses, are also closed for the inauguration tomorrow. Whether your children have school or not, you can celebrate history with them tonight, at the Kids Inaugural, which will be hosted by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden and feature Sasha and Malia's favorites \u2013 the Jonas Brothers \u2013 among others. You don't have to go to Washington (where there are no more tickets available.) You can watch it on the Disney Channel.   If you are looking for facts and folklore to go with your pop-singers, check out \"Our White House Inauguaration Celebration Kit!\" created by the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance. There you will find everything you might ever want to know about Inaugural history, on variety of school-age reading levels.  I have been hearing from parents in recent weeks who are considering taking their kids out of class, maybe just during lunchtime (or, on the West coast, for a late breakfast\u2026) so the family can watch the event, which starts at 11:30 EST, together. As it happens, my boys are off from school, for Superintendent's Day, and we'll be hanging on our couch together, which is where we found ourselves often this past year \u2013 watching Presidential debates, or waiting for primary, and then general, election night returns.

Odds are not quite as good, that you are, too. (About 31 percent of businesses are expected to give employees the day off.)   It is becoming traditional to commemorate Martin Luther King Day as a day of service, and this year the incoming President has particularly stressed that theme. So if you are home, and are looking for a way to better the world with your children, here are a few suggestions.   Examiner.com has culled a list of children's service events, all in the New York area:     Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Celebration_Jewish Community Center 334 Amsterdam Ave. (at 76th St) Upper West Side When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 11am\u20132pm   Description: Today is all about bettering the community with your tots. At the JCC, families can create welcome kits for children coming into hospitals as part of the Camp Sunshine project, as well as prepare meals that will be delivered to local shelters. To round out the event, kids can write letters to President-Elect Obama on the eve of the historic inauguration. All ages.  Children for Children: 7th Annual Grow Involved on MLK Jr. Day At 2 locations: Harlem / Wash. Heights 176 East 115th St. 122 Amsterdam Ave. When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 10am\u20132pm .  Description: Stop by either location between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to join thousands of children and adults in celebration of Dr. King's famous words, \"Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.\" Last year, more than 2,000 volunteers came together for this event and we look forward to another momentous day this year. Participants will have the chance to complete a wide variety of hands-on projects, benefiting many different New York City-based and international causes.  Green Apple Corps Seward Park, East Broadway and Essex St. in Lower East Side/Chinatown When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 9:00am\u20132:45pm; feel free to show up at any time   Description: Green Apple Corps will host a special Day of Service at Seward Park, to celebrate MLK's legacy and participate in urban environmental stewardship. Students and families are welcome to participate! Activities include street tree pit care, mulching and composting, nature tours around Seward Park, and environmental education with the Urban Park Rangers and Green Apple Corps.  Hundreds more possibilities, across the country, can be found on my.mlkday.gov and USAservice.org. Both sites turned up several dozen events within a 25 mile radius of my house.   Some schools, though not many businesses, are also closed for the inauguration tomorrow. Whether your children have school or not, you can celebrate history with them tonight, at the Kids Inaugural, which will be hosted by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden and feature Sasha and Malia's favorites \u2013 the Jonas Brothers \u2013 among others. You don't have to go to Washington (where there are no more tickets available.) You can watch it on the Disney Channel.   If you are looking for facts and folklore to go with your pop-singers, check out \"Our White House Inauguaration Celebration Kit!\" created by the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance. There you will find everything you might ever want to know about Inaugural history, on variety of school-age reading levels.  I have been hearing from parents in recent weeks who are considering taking their kids out of class, maybe just during lunchtime (or, on the West coast, for a late breakfast\u2026) so the family can watch the event, which starts at 11:30 EST, together. As it happens, my boys are off from school, for Superintendent's Day, and we'll be hanging on our couch together, which is where we found ourselves often this past year \u2013 watching Presidential debates, or waiting for primary, and then general, election night returns.

Odds are not quite as good, that you are, too. (About 31 percent of businesses are expected to give employees the day off.)   It is becoming traditional to commemorate Martin Luther King Day as a day of service, and this year the incoming President has particularly stressed that theme. So if you are home, and are looking for a way to better the world with your children, here are a few suggestions.   Examiner.com has culled a list of children's service events, all in the New York area:     Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Celebration_Jewish Community Center 334 Amsterdam Ave. (at 76th St) Upper West Side When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 11am\u20132pm   Description: Today is all about bettering the community with your tots. At the JCC, families can create welcome kits for children coming into hospitals as part of the Camp Sunshine project, as well as prepare meals that will be delivered to local shelters. To round out the event, kids can write letters to President-Elect Obama on the eve of the historic inauguration. All ages.  Children for Children: 7th Annual Grow Involved on MLK Jr. Day At 2 locations: Harlem / Wash. Heights 176 East 115th St. 122 Amsterdam Ave. When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 10am\u20132pm .  Description: Stop by either location between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to join thousands of children and adults in celebration of Dr. King's famous words, \"Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.\" Last year, more than 2,000 volunteers came together for this event and we look forward to another momentous day this year. Participants will have the chance to complete a wide variety of hands-on projects, benefiting many different New York City-based and international causes.  Green Apple Corps Seward Park, East Broadway and Essex St. in Lower East Side/Chinatown When: MLK Jr. Day, Monday 9:00am\u20132:45pm; feel free to show up at any time   Description: Green Apple Corps will host a special Day of Service at Seward Park, to celebrate MLK's legacy and participate in urban environmental stewardship. Students and families are welcome to participate! Activities include street tree pit care, mulching and composting, nature tours around Seward Park, and environmental education with the Urban Park Rangers and Green Apple Corps.  Hundreds more possibilities, across the country, can be found on my.mlkday.gov and USAservice.org. Both sites turned up several dozen events within a 25 mile radius of my house.   Some schools, though not many businesses, are also closed for the inauguration tomorrow. Whether your children have school or not, you can celebrate history with them tonight, at the Kids Inaugural, which will be hosted by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden and feature Sasha and Malia's favorites \u2013 the Jonas Brothers \u2013 among others. You don't have to go to Washington (where there are no more tickets available.) You can watch it on the Disney Channel.   If you are looking for facts and folklore to go with your pop-singers, check out \"Our White House Inauguaration Celebration Kit!\" created by the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance. There you will find everything you might ever want to know about Inaugural history, on variety of school-age reading levels.  I have been hearing from parents in recent weeks who are considering taking their kids out of class, maybe just during lunchtime (or, on the West coast, for a late breakfast\u2026) so the family can watch the event, which starts at 11:30 EST, together. As it happens, my boys are off from school, for Superintendent's Day, and we'll be hanging on our couch together, which is where we found ourselves often this past year \u2013 watching Presidential debates, or waiting for primary, and then general, election night returns.

Portland was four hours away on a two-lane road in a station wagon with four brothers.   Roseburg had an active agricultural economy, with lots of fruit and vegetables, some livestock (mostly sheep, I think) and turkeys, and the remains of a prune industry in the form of \"prune dryers,\" tall, oddly shaped barn-like structures that had heaters that dried the Italian Blue Plum into prunes. We also had a built-in cultural bias against anything that was grown or made locally. People that went West in the dust bowl years, picked crops in California in the depression, and worked in the Oakland shipyards in World War II came to southern Oregon in the late '40s to find work logging the native forests. I believe they didn't \"think local\" because they were not sure where they were. Several good local cheese makers gave up in the '50s or early '60s. (Anyone remember Langlois cheese?) There was a terrific melon from Dillard, Ore., an elegant cantaloupe from an ideal microclimate. We grew terrific pole beans, good strawberries and very good walnuts. I don't think much of that is left.   I set out to rescue the Bartlett pear market, provide myself with a decent supply of poire williams, and maybe make a buck or two.   Another branch of my family had been growing apples and pears in the Hood River Valley in Northern Oregon since 1909. The family lost the orchards in the Great Depression, and maybe another time, depending on how my mother wants to spin the legend. After World War II my dad started buying back the old orchard property, although the original orchards were pretty much gone. In the 1970s we started buying other nearby orchards, and we have been buying in small and large batches, ever since.  I pretty much stayed out of farming and ran the industrial side of the family. My dad had a small company making hunting and shooting accessories. He wanted out, and sold it to me for a dollar down and a dollar a week. It worked out well, I made two or three good decisions and it grew like crazy. And so I thought I was hot stuff, a marketing genius. I was unimpressed by what I saw of fruit marketing. Or fruit growing, for that matter. The local fruit growers were pretty well wedded to chemicals, and odd varieties of apples and pears were being driven out by an industry devotion to the Red Delicious apple. And of course, if you went to a local grocery, even in the fall harvest season, the fruit you encountered was right off a truck that had come from a warehouse a hundred miles away. Small fruit growing regions \u2014 and Hood River Valley at 15,000 acres of orchards was very small \u2014 had a hard time attracting capital and management and marketing talent to compete here in America, let alone in the world market.  The other thing I should mention is that it was my good fortune to spend a lot of time in Europe, starting in 1960. There, I developed an interest in good French regional wine, which led to an interest in almost any wine from Europe, and that led to an interest in everything else from Europe that I could eat or drink. Eventually I came to appreciate that the people I met ate and drank only what they grew \u2014 what they had. Their genius was taking whatever they could grow and making something wonderful out of it. Poor land that could only support goats led to chevre. Undrinkable ugni blanc wine led to cognac. Small, crummy apples in Normandy led to Calvados. And so on.   Eventually I learned that the Williams pear, which the French, Swiss and Germans made into the fantastic Williams pear schnapps, or eau de vie of poire williams, was the same as our Bartlett pear. (Photo: (David Karp for The New York Times) A Bartlett pear.) The Bartlett pear was the principal ingredient of fruit cocktail, which my generation back home had been raised on. But as the fruit cocktail died a well-earned death, the market for the Bartlett pear swooned. And that's how I got into trouble. I came home and set out to rescue the Bartlett pear market, save orchard farmland from development for tract homes, provide myself with a decent supply of good poire williams, which was impossible to get in Oregon at that time, and maybe make a buck or two.   I did most of it. I started with an empty warehouse in an old industrial neighborhood in Northwest Portland. My hope was that inasmuch at the Bartlett and Williams pears are the same, and the still I bought was the genuine European item, and the techniques were simple, that I could eventually learn how to make good poire williams.   I expected it would take years to get something I could take to market. But my first still load, in the fall of 1985, was good. That first taste was good. Pear growing, pear ripening, pear crushing, pear fermentation and pear distillation seemed almost intuitive. We had a lot to learn, of course. There is a difference between making 500 gallons of pear mash, and making 60,000 gallons. Last year alone, my distillery bought 500,000 pounds of Oregon pears.   And Roseburg, where I grew up and which I left decades ago, is now a hotbed of imaginative, innovative winemaking. No longer just poison oak, sheep and scrub oak grow in those valleys and on those pretty hills. Rows of hot weather grape varietals miraculously correct for the microclimate produce fruit that produces unusual and wonderful wines. The scrub oak, actually Oregon White Oak, or quercus garryana, is now made into barrels for aging wine and whiskey. An hour south, Rogue Creamery Blue Cheese is made and sold, and they can't make enough each year. I don't know if the Dillard melons are back, and I know the pole beans are not, but now even modest restaurants in Roseburg proudly list \"local\" cheese and \"local\" wine.

Madoff, according to a list made public in bankruptcy court filings Thursday.", "lead_paragraph": "One of Silicon Valley's legends, Arthur Rock, invested with Bernard L. Madoff, according to the customer list made public Wednesday in bankruptcy court filings.   Mr. Rock, one of the founding fathers of venture capital, invested with Mr. Madoff through five trusts, according to the list.   Mr. Rock helped found and finance Fairchild Semiconductor. As a venture capitalist with Davis & Rock and later Arthur Rock & Company, he financed Apple and Intel in their early days. In 2008, Mr. Rock's net worth was $1.1 billion, making him No. 1,014 on the list of the richest people in the world, according to Forbes.   A few important caveats: there is no way to tell from the list whether Mr. Rock and other investors were victims of Mr. Madoff's reputed $50 billion Ponzi scheme or customers of his legitimate broker-dealer operation. Additionally, some people on the list may be trustees for accounts opened for other people.   Mr. Rock was unavailable to comment and the person who answered the phone at his office could not confirm whether Mr. Rock invested with Mr. Madoff, though his office address matches the address in the filing.   In 1957, when Mr. Rock was working as an investment banker at Hayden Stone, a New York firm, he heard from a group of eight scientists at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories who wanted to start their own company. He helped the scientists, known as the \"Traitorous Eight,\" start Fairchild Semiconductor within Fairchild Camera and Instrument.   Fairchild earned Silicon Valley its status as the heart of the computing industry and gave birth to the Valley tradition of employees' leaving companies, raising capital and founding start-ups, as my colleague Ashlee Vance wrote in his book, \"Geek Silicon Valley\".   In 1961, Mr. Rock moved to Silicon Valley and created Davis & Rock, an early venture capital firm, with Tommy Davis. They invested in Teledyne and Scientific Data Systems, which Xerox acquired. In 1968, Mr. Rock formed Arthur Rock & Company, another investment firm through which he helped Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore -- two of the \"Traitorous Eight\" -- form Intel, an investment that made Mr. Rock a billionaire. Later, Mr. Rock invested in Apple when it was still in its infancy.   Mr. Rock's role in creating Silicon Valley earned him a place on the cover of Time magazine in 1984. In 2003, he gave $25 million to Harvard Business School, his alma mater, to form the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship. Now in his 80s, Mr. Rock still advises and invests in young technology companies through Arthur Rock & Company.   He summed up his investment philosophy for Harvard Business School's Alumni Bulletin in 1997: \"If you're interested in building a business to make money, forget it. You won't. If you're interested in building a business to make a contribution to society, then let's talk.\" ", "abstract": "Arthur Rock, who backed Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel and Apple, invested with Bernard L.

But just how relaxed (or smug) should Mac users be? It's true that very few viruses have been written for Macs -- and none are spreading actively right now. Similarly, hacker programs distributed by malicious Web sites typically run only on PCs.   Yet Macs' relative safety is primarily due to their still-slim market share. They're simply a waste of time for today's attackers, who are trying to accomplish crime on a large scale by infiltrating millions of computers. And there's nothing inherently more secure about a Mac. Researchers found 26 vulnerabilities in OS X in 2008, about the same as in Windows Vista (27), according to the security software maker Symantec. If its market share rises enough, the Mac will become a target and attacks will succeed.  So, what does this mean for Mac users? Should they buy security software just to be safe? Are there steps to take to minimize risk? I called up Rich Mogull, founder of the security consultancy Securosis and a contributor to the Mac news site TidBITS, to get some answers.   Here's the lowdown:  * For most, security software isn't necessary. \"The risk to Mac users at this time is too low, and the benefits provided by extra software are not worth the cost,\" Mogull says. (Products from Symantec run from $50 a year to $90, while Intego's sell for $40 to $100. See product reviews here.) The exceptions: people whose employers require it and people who are into pornography, online gambling or file sharing. On sketchy sites, you could stumble upon a Trojan horse for Macs, \"and they are pretty bad if you get one,\" he says.  * Use the built-in firewall, especially if you use a laptop in cafes, hotels or other public places. Go to \"System Preferences,\" click \"Security\" and then \"Firewall.\" Mogull recommends choosing \"Set access for specific services and applications,\" and then allow connections as you need them.   * Use e-mail services that provide virus and spam filtering, like Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Gmail or Apple's own MobileMe. These providers will quickly block any new viruses.  * For browsing the Web, consider using Firefox with the no-script plug-in. Some users will find it annoyingly disruptive to have every JavaScript blocked, but it's a blessing \"for the really paranoid, like me,\" Mogull says. Also consider using one browser just for banking, a tactic that will protect you from some Web-based attacks.  * Say yes to the software updates Apple sends your way. Many are fixes for security vulnerabilities that could leave you open to attack.   * Keep in mind that many common scams exploit the vulnerabilities of humans, not machines. You are not immune from \"phishing\" scams that aim to trick you into disclosing sensitive information that can be used in fraud schemes.   So be cool, just not too comfy.

Real time traffic feeds? An updated list of subway disruptions?  Over the weekend, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, and Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer suggested the administration create a mobile 311 application for the mobile generation. The specifics are quite mushy, but the idea is that New Yorkers should be able to to check public school closings, find out about alternate-side parking rules suspensions, and to report potholes. (A lot of the calls to 311 are for basic information, according to the city's annual survey, available as a PDF.)   Some 311-type functions -- like uploading a picture of a pothole or looking at traffic cams -- can already be done from a phone through the city's mobile Web site (which is a redirect from www.nyc.gov, courtesy of Usablenet). The problem is that's just not branded under 311. It's splayed all over the nyc.gov site.  As with other cities who have 311 services, like Baltimore and San Francisco, New York's technologists are putting a lot of the information on the Web to streamline the burdens on the operators.  And the city intends to move more of it under the 311 brand. \"We are absolutely working toward that,\" said Nick Sbordone, spokesman for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunication, the agency that oversees 311. As he explained, 311 \"is more a philosophy than a call center,\" in that it's about presenting information to people when they want it, how they want it.  However, some City Council members said they think there needs to be specific mobile application, not just Web content, since it would also engage the younger generation of New Yorkers. (The agency says it is open to this approach.)  Mobile applications have become the flavor du jour with the latest generation of phones. One of the reasons that Apple lost the desktop war with the PC was that fewer programs were written for the Macintosh. Apple learned its lesson and the company threw open the platform with the iPhone and unleashed developers' creativity. Google's Android phone platform also opened a mobile application store for paid programs. And BlackBerry just announced that it would open an online software retail presence.  The downside? Since no mobile platform -- Palm, Blackberry, Google's Android, iPhone -- has more than a 50 percent market share, the mobile application space is completely fragmented. Developers complain that they have to implement their content hundreds of times.  One thought: Maybe if the city opened its data about schools, parking rules and potholes, it could also attract developers to create 311-type applications. Different groups, including the Sunlight Foundation, have been pushing governments on all levels to release more data in structured form. And Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, has a new mantra: Raw. Data. Now.  Maybe we could get ... Raw. City. Data. Now.  Mr. Sbordone was asked if the administration was thinking of opening its application programming interface, or API, as many companies like Google, Flickr, Twitter, and even The New York Times have done.

Shortly after another two guests had to be squeezed in to another table.  All in a day's work, according to Bill Homan, an owner of Design Cuisine, the catering company.  As the pheasant was being sliced, an adult voice called out: \"Watch the plastic, girls,\" as Malia and Sasha, President Obama's children, appeared in the make-shift kitchen off Statuary Hall in the Capitol. They were on their way to the lunch in the Rayburn room for them and the Biden grandchildren. Sasha was waving her hands like a conductor, keeping time to music on a nearby television.  The lunch began about 20 minutes late, around 1:35 p.m., with a seafood stew and a puff pastry topping, created to take the chill off the bones.  But not before Senator Diane Feinstein, chairwoman of the Joint Inaugural Committee of Congress, announced that more people visited the recipe page than any other page on the Inaugural web site.  Suddenly the makeshift kitchen, which had been very quiet, went into overdrive: voices rose as the supervisors and chefs and waiters became more agitated.  Shh. Shh. Shh.   And eventually everyone quieted down as they rushed to get the food out. After all the meal is supposed to be served and consumed in about an hour. It wasn't.  With 24 tables it is inevitable that some people are being served their main course while others haven't quite finished their soup, which was served with a 2007 Duckhorn sauvignon blanc.  The decibel level rose again as the platters of perfectly cooked duck and pheasant served on a beautiful bed of carrots, asparagus, wax beans, beets and spinach, were readied.  They were followed by pureed sweet potatoes and then miniature corn muffins, into which a small piece of corn husk had been baked.  A 2005 Goldeneye Pinot Noir accompanied the main course.  Dessert service was interrupted when Senator Ted Kennedy, who is undergoing treatment for brain cancer, had a seizure and was rushed to the hospital.  But the show must go on and a cinnamon apple cake with vanilla bean ice cream, saut\u00e9ed apple cubes and sauce was served with Korbel champagne.  As the lunch ended, President Obama thanked all the appropriate people and then gave a shout-out to the staff for their good work.  The staff was delighted when Senator Hillary Clinton, Mr. Obama's nominee for Secretary of State, told the staff the lunch was \"fabulous.\" She added, \"the dessert was excellent.\"  The day had begun at 4 a.m. in bone-chilling cold, when the van from Design Cuisine commenced its high-security expedition into the capital from Virginia. Their mission was lunch for 234 guests, including the newly sworn in President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and even with a police escort they were stopped at check points and searched by dogs.  Security dogs were frequent visitors throughout the morning as the caterers and waiter staff went about their business just off Statuary Hall. In the years that the Joint Inaugural Committee of Congress has been serving the traditional lunch to some Congressional leaders, cabinet secretaries and friends of the new first families following the Inauguration ceremony, security has never been so tight.  So tight that Rickie Niceta Lloyd, an account executive for Design Cuisine, slept over in the Capitol building, just to avoid the hassles on Tuesday morning. She was not alone: A group of women slipped into some warm clothes and camped out in the building, to be ready when the food and staff arrived before dawn. \"It was just like being in a dorm,\" she said.  Once in, the cooks and waiter staff quickly got to work, beginning the final steps to prepare the traditional three-course meal. The cooks worked behind a curtain, getting the food, some of which was pre-cooked, ready for serving. The Design Cuisine staff had set the tables earlier. They were covered with blue damask cloths, the chairs covered with matching blue velvet pillows. On each table were centerpieces of white and lavender hydrangeas and two kinds of red roses, a larger display at the head table.  The place plates are copies of the Lincoln china, with the purple border that looked red at the lunch; the silver was gold-plated. Four glasses stood at each plate \u2013 two wine, a water glass and a champagne flute.  The menu, like the plates, continued the Abraham Lincoln thread that has run through Mr. Obama's campaign for the presidency, the transition and the Inauguration festivities. It was modeled after a Lincoln menu.  Taking into account Mr. Obama's young children, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, and the many Biden grandchildren who were in attendance, there was a children's menu, served in the nearby Rayburn Room.   Hot dogs Cheeseburgers Macaroni and cheese  French fries Grilled cheese sandwiches Cheese pizza Chocolate chip cookies Apple and orange juices and soft drinks    The new president and vice president were presented gifts from Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Joint Inaugural Committee: heavy glass bowls from Lenox, etched with the White House for Mr. Obama and the Capitol for Mr. Biden.

Real time traffic feeds? An updated list of subway disruptions?  Over the weekend, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, and Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer suggested the administration create a mobile 311 application for the mobile generation. The specifics are quite mushy, but the idea is that New Yorkers should be able to to check public school closings, find out about alternate-side parking rules suspensions, and to report potholes. (A lot of the calls to 311 are for basic information, according to the city's annual survey, available as a PDF.)   Some 311-type functions -- like uploading a picture of a pothole or looking at traffic cams -- can already be done from a phone through the city's mobile Web site (which is a redirect from www.nyc.gov, courtesy of Usablenet). The problem is that's just not branded under 311. It's splayed all over the nyc.gov site.  As with other cities who have 311 services, like Baltimore and San Francisco, New York's technologists are putting a lot of the information on the Web to streamline the burdens on the operators.  And the city intends to move more of it under the 311 brand. \"We are absolutely working toward that,\" said Nick Sbordone, spokesman for the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunication, the agency that oversees 311. As he explained, 311 \"is more a philosophy than a call center,\" in that it's about presenting information to people when they want it, how they want it.  However, some City Council members said they think there needs to be specific mobile application, not just Web content, since it would also engage the younger generation of New Yorkers. (The agency says it is open to this approach.)  Mobile applications have become the flavor du jour with the latest generation of phones. One of the reasons that Apple lost the desktop war with the PC was that fewer programs were written for the Macintosh. Apple learned its lesson and the company threw open the platform with the iPhone and unleashed developers' creativity. Google's Android phone platform also opened a mobile application store for paid programs. And BlackBerry just announced that it would open an online software retail presence.  The downside? Since no mobile platform -- Palm, Blackberry, Google's Android, iPhone -- has more than a 50 percent market share, the mobile application space is completely fragmented. Developers complain that they have to implement their content hundreds of times.  One thought: Maybe if the city opened its data about schools, parking rules and potholes, it could also attract developers to create 311-type applications. Different groups, including the Sunlight Foundation, have been pushing governments on all levels to release more data in structured form. And Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, has a new mantra: Raw. Data. Now.  Maybe we could get ... Raw. City. Data. Now.  Mr. Sbordone was asked if the administration was thinking of opening its application programming interface, or API, as many companies like Google, Flickr, Twitter, and even The New York Times have done.  The city is exploring it, Mr. Sbordone said.  Well. If they are going to create a mobile application, what kind of functionality do you think should be put in it?

Developers who were holding back products they think are too good to give away will finally break out their wares.  A Google spokesperson said the company had no idea how many apps were waiting, or what they would be, although based on mobile business history, the answer is probably a lot of games.  I'm hoping it's good news for another reason. Maybe charging for apps will inspire the Android Market to become easier to shop.   With more than 1,000 apps in the market, you pretty much have to look at them one-by-one on the phone, or browse the few displayed on the Web site. I would think with Google's excellent search technology, the market would be organized better than Apple's iTunes App market, which I also find lacking.  How about more ways to sort results? By price, popularity, rating or a combination? Maybe an option to read the reviews by star groupings, like Amazon does? Or a better way to discover unknown but worthwhile apps?

Now, NYC Seed, an early-stage technology fund, wants to help transform the Big Apple into a thriving incubator for Internet start-ups.    \"New York is highly underleveraged,\" said Owen Davis, managing director of NYC Seed. \"Start-up companies are a great way to do that.\"   Mr. Davis hopes that by financing newborn local start-ups, the company can expand New York's technical infrastructure and infuse it with some of the ebullient start-up spirit that resonates throughout Silicon Valley.   \"The idea that there's not enough capital at this level of funding is one of the things we were trying to address,\" he said.   To that end, he's brought together some of the crucial components that nurture the West Coast's start-up community. For starters, he enlisted local government agencies and universities to contribute to the fund, which is a partnership of the New York City Investment Fund, Polytechnic Institute of N.Y.U. and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, among others. The organizers have amassed a bankroll of $2 million and will invest up to $200,000 per homegrown start-up.   In addition, the company recruited notable venture capitalists and entrepreneurs for the company's advisory board, including Drew Lipsher of Greycroft Venture Partners and Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, to help guide the budding companies through development.   So far, the community has been responding: Mr. Davis estimated that since NYC Seed was unveiled in June, the company has received upwards of 300 pitches. On Monday, the company announced the first two start-ups selected to receive $200,000 each:   Path101 functions as a recommendation engine, like the ones used by iTunes, Amazon and Pandora, but for careers. The Web-based service analyzes r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and uses personality quizzes to help job seekers find relevant openings in their disciplines.   PlaceVine plays online matchmaker for product placements in film, television and Web shows. The company works with content producers like Fox Films and FunnyorDie to list coming opportunities for marketers to insert branded cans of soda, laptops and labels into their projects.   Mr. Davis said the company hoped to dole out financing to another four start-ups in the next few months. He also said NYC Seed is open to all types of start-up ideas, but prototypes involving social media middleware, real-time search tools, online advertising networks and location-based services have been the most successful at snagging his attention. The only real criterion for applying, he said, is that founders be based in one of the five boroughs.

its financial markets data onto the iPhone.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: )   If you have any money left to invest, a program from Bloomberg offers a wealth of basic stock market data and news on the iPhone for free.  The program, just called \"Bloomberg,\" opens a ticker for the world's stock markets, but can also show markets for bonds, commodities or currencies. Go a little deeper in stocks, you'll find a chart showing how different industries are faring, or which companies stocks are highest in gains or losses.  (Photo: ) You can track your own portfolio in the My Stocks section. Apple's stock results come already loaded, but with a negative 36 percent return over 52 weeks, the company might want to rethink that.  The Stock Finder section gives a description of a company and related news, as well as daily highs and lows, with a 52-week performance summary and chart.   The tiny chart is hard to read, but turn the phone sideways and it automatically goes to a full-screen view. Stocks you have looked up are saved in the stock finder menu, so you can check them again without having to do a new search.  There is a link to download Bloomberg Podcasts (if you need a good sweat, try \"Paul Krugman Sees Need to Get Stimulus Plan Out `Fast'\").

Is there a way to change the dates on the pictures on the computer?  Depending on what system you use, you have at least a couple of options for correcting the date and time information on your photo files.  The Windows Photo Gallery program that comes with Windows Vista can change picture dates and times. Open it from the Programs in the Start menu and click Info in the toolbar to open the Info pane. Click on the picture or pictures you want to adjust and then click on the date in the Info pane. Click on the arrow next to the date and then choose the correct date on the calendar.  The photo's time can be adjusted in a similar way in the Info pane's time area. Microsoft has more information here.  Shareware programs that let you edit the photo's embedded data can also do the job. Exifer is one such program for Windows XP and there are plenty of other similar applications in shareware archives around the Web like Download.com.  Mac OS X users can change picture dates and times in recent versions of the free iPhoto program that comes with new Apple computers. To use iPhoto, open the program and select the photos that need to be adjusted. Go to the Photos menu and choose Adjust Date and Time to fix the picture timestamps.

His take: \"If you live on mobile sites and your goal is to manage all of your personal information and to manage it on the go, the Palm Pre may be the best.\"  The reason is the phone's outstanding feature: it can collect all of your contact information from disparate places -- say, Outlook files from your computer, corporate files from the office, Web directories like Facebook -- and make them appear as a single contact list on the phone.   It will perform a similar feat for e-mail and instant messaging.  The features are described in a slow-moving keynote speech that you can see in an HD movie online.   As exciting as Mr. Greengart found the Pre, he was quick to point out that the new Palm operating system, WebOS, is \"a terrific interface, but there is a learning curve.\" For that reason it won't crush the easy-to-use iPhone. But, said Mr. Greengart, \"It doesn't have to be a iPhone killer, it has to be an iPhone competitor.\"  The Pre will be offered by Sprint in the first half of 2009. No price has been announced.  Releasing a single phone with a single carrier is a risky move for Palm, which essentially created the personal digital assistant market, but has lost ground to R.I.M., Apple and Windows phones. \"I don't want to be too rosy here. This is really a bet-the-company move,\" said Mr. Greengart. The Pre has to attract app developers who are more focused on the larger and growing audience already using iPhones and BlackBerry phones. Not to mention those phone owners themselves.

As fast as the computer industry moves, Acer seems to move faster.  Spearheading the netbook movement and regularly undercutting the higher-priced spreads of laptops offered by the competition, Acer is surging ahead in market share, and while it's still chasing Hewlett-Packard and Dell, the company, which is based in Taiwan, is not letting up.  Just this week, the company unwrapped its Timeline series of notebooks, with prices starting at about $700. That's $700 for Acer's flagship product. Power-saving is the angle with the Timelines, as Acer claims up to 8 hours of battery life with a conventional hard drive, and 10 hours with a solid-state drive. The heaviest model in the lineup is just more than five pounds; the lightest is 3.5 pounds. Compare the Timeline to Dell's new Adamo, selling at more than twice the price.  And as for the cool factor, well, it's evident. The Aspire Timelines promise to turn the heat down with their \"Laminar Wall Jet\" technology, which is supposed to redirect cooling air along the bottom side of the notebook. Developed with Intel, Laminar Wall Jet incorporates a design used to cool turbine blades. Cool!  There are a few screen sizes, from 13 inches to 15 inches, an Apple-like trackpad that supports pinch functions, and scads of options and add-ons. \"We are confident we have exceeded our customers' expectations once again,\" said Acer's chief executive, Gianfranco Lanci.  Mr. Lanci said in an interview with Business Week that his company's low overhead and outsourcing strategies gave Acer an edge in aggressively cutting prices. The company is also jumping into the smartphone market. \"To run a business with lower costs is good when the market is growing,\" Mr. Lanci said. \"It's even better when the market is not growing.\" ", "abstract": "Acer aggressively chases the PC market with new notebooks.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "popup", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.395.jpg", "height": 218, "width": 395, "legacy": {}, "subType": "popup", "crop_name": "popup"}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "sfSpan", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.395.jpg", "height": 218, "width": 395, "legacy": {}, "subType": "sfSpan", "crop_name": "sfSpan"}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard"}], "headline": {"main": "Essentially Cool: Acer's Timeline Notebooks", "kicker": "Gadgetwise", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Essentially Cool: Acer's Timeline Notebooks", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-04-10T20:46:08+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/0444fa87-c543-51c5-88fc-087234725012", "word_count": 297, "uri": "nyt://article/0444fa87-c543-51c5-88fc-087234725012"}, {"web_url": "https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/play-ball-opening-day-on-the-web/", "snippet": "As the baseball season begins, Major League Baseball is hoping to sell fans on new ways to follow their teams online.", "lead_paragraph": " The 2009 Major League Baseball season starts today, which for fans of franchises like the Chicago Cubs, Kansas City Royals and my own hapless Cleveland Indians, means it\u2019s time for our annual dose of extended aggravation.

A pair of researchers at the security software maker Symantec have found what may be the first successful Mac \"botnet,\" ZDNET reports.   A botnet is a group of computers -- often home machines -- that have been quietly infiltrated, commandeered and networked by attackers so they can be used to carry out any number of nefarious acts. This one has apparently been making denial-of-service attacks against an unnamed Web site, which means it has been hitting the site with tons of Web traffic in an effort to knock it out of service.   According to the Symantec researchers, the botnet has some sophisticated capabilities that suggest the work of an experienced programmer who may have rented out his creation to someone else who actually used it for denial-of-service attacks, a common pattern seen in botnets formed from Windows PCs.   Attackers created the botnet by seeding BitTorrent and other file-sharing sites with pirated software that contained a Trojan Horse. Some 20,000 Mac users had downloaded bad copies of Apple's iWork 09 by the time Intego, a security software company that sells products for Macs, publicized its findings in January. Intego found a second version of the Trojan Horse a few days later inside copies of Adobe Photoshop CS4 for Mac.   This activity is still somewhat primitive, says Dino A. Dai Zovi, an independent security researcher and author of \"The Mac Hackers Handbook.\" \"Trojaned pirated software is still an early phase in the rise of malware on a platform.

A pair of researchers at the security software maker Symantec have found what may be the first successful Mac \"botnet,\" ZDNET reports.   A botnet is a group of computers -- often home machines -- that have been quietly infiltrated, commandeered and networked by attackers so they can be used to carry out any number of nefarious acts. This one has apparently been making denial-of-service attacks against an unnamed Web site, which means it has been hitting the site with tons of Web traffic in an effort to knock it out of service.   According to the Symantec researchers, the botnet has some sophisticated capabilities that suggest the work of an experienced programmer who may have rented out his creation to someone else who actually used it for denial-of-service attacks, a common pattern seen in botnets formed from Windows PCs.   Attackers created the botnet by seeding BitTorrent and other file-sharing sites with pirated software that contained a Trojan Horse. Some 20,000 Mac users had downloaded bad copies of Apple's iWork 09 by the time Intego, a security software company that sells products for Macs, publicized its findings in January. Intego found a second version of the Trojan Horse a few days later inside copies of Adobe Photoshop CS4 for Mac.   This activity is still somewhat primitive, says Dino A. Dai Zovi, an independent security researcher and author of \"The Mac Hackers Handbook.\" \"Trojaned pirated software is still an early phase in the rise of malware on a platform.

As fast as the computer industry moves, Acer seems to move faster.  Spearheading the netbook movement and regularly undercutting the higher-priced spreads of laptops offered by the competition, Acer is surging ahead in market share, and while it's still chasing Hewlett-Packard and Dell, the company, which is based in Taiwan, is not letting up.  Just this week, the company unwrapped its Timeline series of notebooks, with prices starting at about $700. That's $700 for Acer's flagship product. Power-saving is the angle with the Timelines, as Acer claims up to 8 hours of battery life with a conventional hard drive, and 10 hours with a solid-state drive. The heaviest model in the lineup is just more than five pounds; the lightest is 3.5 pounds. Compare the Timeline to Dell's new Adamo, selling at more than twice the price.  And as for the cool factor, well, it's evident. The Aspire Timelines promise to turn the heat down with their \"Laminar Wall Jet\" technology, which is supposed to redirect cooling air along the bottom side of the notebook. Developed with Intel, Laminar Wall Jet incorporates a design used to cool turbine blades. Cool!  There are a few screen sizes, from 13 inches to 15 inches, an Apple-like trackpad that supports pinch functions, and scads of options and add-ons. \"We are confident we have exceeded our customers' expectations once again,\" said Acer's chief executive, Gianfranco Lanci.  Mr. Lanci said in an interview with Business Week that his company's low overhead and outsourcing strategies gave Acer an edge in aggressively cutting prices. The company is also jumping into the smartphone market. \"To run a business with lower costs is good when the market is growing,\" Mr. Lanci said. \"It's even better when the market is not growing.\" ", "abstract": "Acer aggressively chases the PC market with new notebooks.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "popup", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.395.jpg", "height": 218, "width": 395, "legacy": {}, "subType": "popup", "crop_name": "popup"}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "sfSpan", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.395.jpg", "height": 218, "width": 395, "legacy": {}, "subType": "sfSpan", "crop_name": "sfSpan"}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2009/04/16/technology/personaltech/16acer.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard"}], "headline": {"main": "Essentially Cool: Acer's Timeline Notebooks", "kicker": "Gadgetwise", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Essentially Cool: Acer's Timeline Notebooks", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-04-10T20:46:08+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/0444fa87-c543-51c5-88fc-087234725012", "word_count": 297, "uri": "nyt://article/0444fa87-c543-51c5-88fc-087234725012"}, {"web_url": "https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/play-ball-opening-day-on-the-web/", "snippet": "As the baseball season begins, Major League Baseball is hoping to sell fans on new ways to follow their teams online.", "lead_paragraph": " The 2009 Major League Baseball season starts today, which for fans of franchises like the Chicago Cubs, Kansas City Royals and my own hapless Cleveland Indians, means it\u2019s time for our annual dose of extended aggravation.

Here's a quick guide to help you get better acquainted.  Vudu (The Oldest Child)  What It Is: A box that lets you rent or buy movies to watch instantly on your television.  Price: $150.  Rental Fees: Renting standard-definition movies costs $1 to $4; high-definition and HDX movies (see below for explanation) cost $4 to $6. Users can also buy TV episodes for $2 and movies from $5 to $20.  Number of Titles: 14,000 movies and TV episodes, including what the company calls \"the largest HD library anywhere\" with over 1,400 movies.   The Good: Great picture quality, clean user interface and no monthly fee. Vudu delivers actual HD-quality viewing (up to 1080p) and 5.1 Dolby surround sound thanks in part to deals with Lionsgate, Paramount and Universal Studios. Vudu also offers 500 titles in HDX, a video format that has been optimized for 40-inch and larger HDTVs. But be warned: HDX download times are long -- think hours, not minutes. Users can buy movies the same day they're released on DVD.  The Bad: Erases rented movies after 24 hours, after which you have to pay $1 for a one-day extension. No built-in Wi-Fi, but a Vudu Wireless kit costs $80.  What's New: Vudu just added the Web-based music application Pandora to its collection of more than 120 Web-based video content channels, which already includes Picasa, YouTube and Flickr.  Roku (The Middle Child)  What It Is: The Roku digital video player, also known as the Netflix Player by Roku, is a box that streams Netflix and Amazon Video On Demand movies over the Internet to your television.  Price: $100.  Rental Fees: Roku requires a Netflix unlimited instant-watch account, which starts at $9. Amazon has both rental and purchase options. Rentals cost about $1 to $4. Purchases run from about $1 for TV shows and about $15 for movies.  Number of Titles: Over 50,000. (About 12,000 from Netflix and 40,000 from Amazon).  The Good: A lot of companies claim their units can be installed by a child. The Roku actually can. I was up and running in three minutes. The \"getting started\" manual is one of the simplest, most dummy-proof visual guides I've seen. The Roku also comes with built-in Wi-Fi so no adapter is needed and it's extremely compact (5.1 inches by 5.1 inches by 1.6 inches) so it won't hog your living space.  The Bad: The No. 1 gripe is its limited selection. Netflix's Instant Watch option trails Netflix's much larger DVD-by-mail catalog. My Netflix Instant Watch lists 1995's \"To Die For\" and 1998's \"The Waterboy\" among its \"new\" movie releases. By comparison, my new movie releases for the DVD-by-mail option include \"Changeling\" and \"Burn After Reading.\" I also encountered some buffering delays when I used the fast-forward/rewind controls.  What's New: This summer, Roku will release its software developer's kit for Web video providers, so expect more channels. It will also soon offer ad-supported and free content. The company is looking into online photo and music services.  Boxee (The Youngest Child)  What It Is: This service integrates and creates a single interface for the photos, music and video on your computer's hard drive. Boxee also lets users stream content from Netflix, YouTube, CNN.com and other sites for access on your television.  Price: Free.  The Good: No box needed. Downloads straight onto your desktop. Also good if you enjoy the social-networking aspect of entertainment. Boxee automatically updates your Twitter, Tumblr and FriendFeed accounts and shares your friends' activity so you can follow, recommend and find new content. The service also works on Apple TV and, because it operates on an open-source platform, allows users to personalize what they view by letting them add music and video sites.  The Bad: Have to sit through commercials. For now, Boxee is only compatible with Mac and Linux computers. Another snag: Earlier this month, the free online video service Hulu blocked the Boxee browser from accessing its site. Best case situation? The Hulu block proves to be an isolated incident. Worst case? Other companies follow suit. Also, Boxee works only on content without digital rights management. And the nontechie Boxee user will probably find configuring Linux and Apple TV difficult.  What's New: New alpha version released March 24.

busy commercial street in Chinatown. (Photo: John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times))   Updated, 11:21 p.m. &#124; An unoccupied delivery van that had been left in reverse backed into a crowd of people, including a group of preschoolers, on a busy commercial street in Chinatown on Thursday morning, killing two small children and injuring a dozen other people, the authorities said. (Please read the updated article from Friday's print edition.)  The accident occurred at 11:31 a.m. outside the Wing Hing Center, a commercial building at 39 East Broadway, between Market and Catherine Streets.   The authorities said that a 4-year-old girl, Hayley Ng of the Lower East Side, was killed almost immediately. She was pronounced dead at the scene.   Two other children, a 3-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, were critically injured and taken to New York Downtown Hospital. There, about an hour later, the boy, identified as Diego Martinez, of Chelsea, died.   \"Despite heroic efforts of our emergency-room staff, the child was pronounced dead,\" at 12:33 p.m., said Dr. Warren B. Licht, the hospital's chief medical officer. \"Everything possible was tried to save this child's life.\"   Eleven other people, both children and adults, sustained minor injuries. Some were taken to New York Downtown Hospital, and others to Bellevue Hospital Center.   When the accident occurred, around 14 children were being led in a \"daisy chain\" line -- holding onto each other and accompanied by adult chaperons -- along East Broadway from a library visit back to their day care program, the Red Apple Child Development Center, at 25 Market Street, the police said.   The van, a 2000 Ford, was traveling on East Broadway and appeared to make a three-point turn to make a delivery. Shortly after -- witnesses at times gave conflicting accounts -- the van lurched, going in reverse over the curb and onto the sidewalk, according to witnesses.  Early in the day, the police had said that before the accident the van had stopped and the driver had gotten out, and that the vehicle then began to move, without anyone behind the wheel. The police later appeared to retract that account, but by Thursday evening the authorities were again saying that the driver, Chao Fu, 52, had double-parked and entered a store, leaving the van running and in reverse gear, thinking it was in park. Mr. Fu was not charged.   Alma Torres, 49, who was standing across the street from the scene of the accident, said of the driver: \"He backed up. He jumped the curb. You heard the bang. People started running.\" Ms. Torres said she later saw a Chinese woman, distraught and screaming.   Anthony Amoroso, 50, who lives in East New York, Brooklyn, said of the driver: \"He was making a three-point turn. He backed up onto the sidewalk.\" All he heard after that, Mr. Amoroso, was \"the screaming.\"  Another man, Kenneth Martin, 41, of Bushwick, Brooklyn, saw the aftermath of the accident and described seeing a girl being placed in an ambulance. \"She was scared,\" Mr. Martin said. \"Her arms were lifted up.\"   Pamela Leitstein, 48, who is also from East New York, said: \"It was chaos.\" Katharine Montaldo, 39, from the East Village, said: \"I heard screaming. I came running up. All I saw was blood.\"   Police officials said the driver of the truck did not leave the scene of the accident. Witnesses gave varying accounts of the driver's actions after the crash: one said he left the van as if in a state of shock, while another witness that police officers removed the driver from the van.   A silver-gray van with the name of a company, China Chalet, emblazoned on its side was sitting on the sidewalk along the east side of East Broadway on Thursday afternoon.   On the sidewalk, directly behind the van and in front of the building, the police placed cloth sheets across the sidewalk. The sheets were stained with blood; at moments, the wind briefly blew off one of the sheet, revealing the crumpled body of a small child, wearing gray pants.   A woman who answered the phone Thursday afternoon at China Chalet's office, at 47 Broadway, declined to confirm that its truck was involved in the accident, but said in Chinese that \"something happened.\" The woman said the company's owner was not available for comment, and then hung up.   The block of East Broadway where the accident occurred is a crowded commercial corridor, filled with restaurants and food shops at the base of tenement buildings.  At 33 East Broadway, a few doors down from the scene of the accident, is the historic Chatham Square Branch of the New York Public Library. The branch opened in 1903 and was designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White.   The Red Apple Child Development Center, where the children were enrolled, has two licenses, one for infants and toddlers and one for children 2 to 6 years, according to the Bureau of Child Care at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.   A woman who answered the phone at the child care center on Thursday afternoon said that the situation was unclear. She said in Chinese, \"We don't have any information right now.\"  At about 2 p.m., a grief-stricken man and woman clutching each other were quickly escorted out of the child-care center by police and into a waiting police van, which sped down the street, sirens blaring. The man and woman did not answer questions from reporters.   Later on Thursday afternoon, Xiaoping Fan, director of the day-care center, said in a statement released by its lawyer, Robert S. Wolf:     All of us at Red Apple Child Development Center are stunned and deeply saddened by this tragic accident. Our hearts go out to the families of all of the children involved and especially to the two families who suffered the loss of their child. We are doing everything possible to provide support to our students, parents, and their loved ones.    The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, who went to the scene of the accident, said in a statement afterward that the accident pointed up the need to better protect pedestrians. Mr. Stringer said:   The Zip code in which 38 East Broadway is located had 25 fatalities and 1,149 injuries from 1995 to 2005, more fatalities than any other Manhattan zip code. And the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets, located just a few blocks from where today's accident occurred, is the third most dangerous location for Manhattan pedestrians. While the city has taken some important steps to manage traffic in Chinatown, including bollards, better lane designations, and other \"traffic calming\" measures, it is clear that more needs to be done, particularly given the congestion created by the continued closing of Park Row, which has been shut to most traffic since 9/11.  In New York City overall last year some 300 people were killed in traffic accidents -- nearly one person every day -- and hundreds more were injured, with children and the elderly being particularly vulnerable on our congested streets. The city must take a systematic look in every neighborhood at measures like sidewalk bollards and speed bumps, as well as strict traffic enforcement, to make it safer for New Yorkers to walk the streets of their city.

Here's a quick guide to help you get better acquainted.  Vudu (The Oldest Child)  What It Is: A box that lets you rent or buy movies to watch instantly on your television.  Price: $150.  Rental Fees: Renting standard-definition movies costs $1 to $4; high-definition and HDX movies (see below for explanation) cost $4 to $6. Users can also buy TV episodes for $2 and movies from $5 to $20.  Number of Titles: 14,000 movies and TV episodes, including what the company calls \"the largest HD library anywhere\" with over 1,400 movies.   The Good: Great picture quality, clean user interface and no monthly fee. Vudu delivers actual HD-quality viewing (up to 1080p) and 5.1 Dolby surround sound thanks in part to deals with Lionsgate, Paramount and Universal Studios. Vudu also offers 500 titles in HDX, a video format that has been optimized for 40-inch and larger HDTVs. But be warned: HDX download times are long -- think hours, not minutes. Users can buy movies the same day they're released on DVD.  The Bad: Erases rented movies after 24 hours, after which you have to pay $1 for a one-day extension. No built-in Wi-Fi, but a Vudu Wireless kit costs $80.  What's New: Vudu just added the Web-based music application Pandora to its collection of more than 120 Web-based video content channels, which already includes Picasa, YouTube and Flickr.  Roku (The Middle Child)  What It Is: The Roku digital video player, also known as the Netflix Player by Roku, is a box that streams Netflix and Amazon Video On Demand movies over the Internet to your television.  Price: $100.  Rental Fees: Roku requires a Netflix unlimited instant-watch account, which starts at $9. Amazon has both rental and purchase options. Rentals cost about $1 to $4. Purchases run from about $1 for TV shows and about $15 for movies.  Number of Titles: Over 50,000. (About 12,000 from Netflix and 40,000 from Amazon).  The Good: A lot of companies claim their units can be installed by a child. The Roku actually can. I was up and running in three minutes. The \"getting started\" manual is one of the simplest, most dummy-proof visual guides I've seen. The Roku also comes with built-in Wi-Fi so no adapter is needed and it's extremely compact (5.1 inches by 5.1 inches by 1.6 inches) so it won't hog your living space.  The Bad: The No. 1 gripe is its limited selection. Netflix's Instant Watch option trails Netflix's much larger DVD-by-mail catalog. My Netflix Instant Watch lists 1995's \"To Die For\" and 1998's \"The Waterboy\" among its \"new\" movie releases. By comparison, my new movie releases for the DVD-by-mail option include \"Changeling\" and \"Burn After Reading.\" I also encountered some buffering delays when I used the fast-forward/rewind controls.  What's New: This summer, Roku will release its software developer's kit for Web video providers, so expect more channels. It will also soon offer ad-supported and free content. The company is looking into online photo and music services.  Boxee (The Youngest Child)  What It Is: This service integrates and creates a single interface for the photos, music and video on your computer's hard drive. Boxee also lets users stream content from Netflix, YouTube, CNN.com and other sites for access on your television.  Price: Free.  The Good: No box needed. Downloads straight onto your desktop. Also good if you enjoy the social-networking aspect of entertainment. Boxee automatically updates your Twitter, Tumblr and FriendFeed accounts and shares your friends' activity so you can follow, recommend and find new content. The service also works on Apple TV and, because it operates on an open-source platform, allows users to personalize what they view by letting them add music and video sites.  The Bad: Have to sit through commercials. For now, Boxee is only compatible with Mac and Linux computers. Another snag: Earlier this month, the free online video service Hulu blocked the Boxee browser from accessing its site. Best case situation? The Hulu block proves to be an isolated incident. Worst case? Other companies follow suit. Also, Boxee works only on content without digital rights management. And the nontechie Boxee user will probably find configuring Linux and Apple TV difficult.  What's New: New alpha version released March 24.

busy commercial street in Chinatown. (Photo: John Marshall Mantel for The New York Times))   Updated, 11:21 p.m. &#124; An unoccupied delivery van that had been left in reverse backed into a crowd of people, including a group of preschoolers, on a busy commercial street in Chinatown on Thursday morning, killing two small children and injuring a dozen other people, the authorities said. (Please read the updated article from Friday's print edition.)  The accident occurred at 11:31 a.m. outside the Wing Hing Center, a commercial building at 39 East Broadway, between Market and Catherine Streets.   The authorities said that a 4-year-old girl, Hayley Ng of the Lower East Side, was killed almost immediately. She was pronounced dead at the scene.   Two other children, a 3-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, were critically injured and taken to New York Downtown Hospital. There, about an hour later, the boy, identified as Diego Martinez, of Chelsea, died.   \"Despite heroic efforts of our emergency-room staff, the child was pronounced dead,\" at 12:33 p.m., said Dr. Warren B. Licht, the hospital's chief medical officer. \"Everything possible was tried to save this child's life.\"   Eleven other people, both children and adults, sustained minor injuries. Some were taken to New York Downtown Hospital, and others to Bellevue Hospital Center.   When the accident occurred, around 14 children were being led in a \"daisy chain\" line -- holding onto each other and accompanied by adult chaperons -- along East Broadway from a library visit back to their day care program, the Red Apple Child Development Center, at 25 Market Street, the police said.   The van, a 2000 Ford, was traveling on East Broadway and appeared to make a three-point turn to make a delivery. Shortly after -- witnesses at times gave conflicting accounts -- the van lurched, going in reverse over the curb and onto the sidewalk, according to witnesses.  Early in the day, the police had said that before the accident the van had stopped and the driver had gotten out, and that the vehicle then began to move, without anyone behind the wheel. The police later appeared to retract that account, but by Thursday evening the authorities were again saying that the driver, Chao Fu, 52, had double-parked and entered a store, leaving the van running and in reverse gear, thinking it was in park. Mr. Fu was not charged.   Alma Torres, 49, who was standing across the street from the scene of the accident, said of the driver: \"He backed up. He jumped the curb. You heard the bang. People started running.\" Ms. Torres said she later saw a Chinese woman, distraught and screaming.   Anthony Amoroso, 50, who lives in East New York, Brooklyn, said of the driver: \"He was making a three-point turn. He backed up onto the sidewalk.\" All he heard after that, Mr. Amoroso, was \"the screaming.\"  Another man, Kenneth Martin, 41, of Bushwick, Brooklyn, saw the aftermath of the accident and described seeing a girl being placed in an ambulance. \"She was scared,\" Mr. Martin said. \"Her arms were lifted up.\"   Pamela Leitstein, 48, who is also from East New York, said: \"It was chaos.\" Katharine Montaldo, 39, from the East Village, said: \"I heard screaming. I came running up. All I saw was blood.\"   Police officials said the driver of the truck did not leave the scene of the accident. Witnesses gave varying accounts of the driver's actions after the crash: one said he left the van as if in a state of shock, while another witness that police officers removed the driver from the van.   A silver-gray van with the name of a company, China Chalet, emblazoned on its side was sitting on the sidewalk along the east side of East Broadway on Thursday afternoon.   On the sidewalk, directly behind the van and in front of the building, the police placed cloth sheets across the sidewalk. The sheets were stained with blood; at moments, the wind briefly blew off one of the sheet, revealing the crumpled body of a small child, wearing gray pants.   A woman who answered the phone Thursday afternoon at China Chalet's office, at 47 Broadway, declined to confirm that its truck was involved in the accident, but said in Chinese that \"something happened.\" The woman said the company's owner was not available for comment, and then hung up.   The block of East Broadway where the accident occurred is a crowded commercial corridor, filled with restaurants and food shops at the base of tenement buildings.  At 33 East Broadway, a few doors down from the scene of the accident, is the historic Chatham Square Branch of the New York Public Library. The branch opened in 1903 and was designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White.   The Red Apple Child Development Center, where the children were enrolled, has two licenses, one for infants and toddlers and one for children 2 to 6 years, according to the Bureau of Child Care at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.   A woman who answered the phone at the child care center on Thursday afternoon said that the situation was unclear. She said in Chinese, \"We don't have any information right now.\"  At about 2 p.m., a grief-stricken man and woman clutching each other were quickly escorted out of the child-care center by police and into a waiting police van, which sped down the street, sirens blaring. The man and woman did not answer questions from reporters.   Later on Thursday afternoon, Xiaoping Fan, director of the day-care center, said in a statement released by its lawyer, Robert S. Wolf:     All of us at Red Apple Child Development Center are stunned and deeply saddened by this tragic accident. Our hearts go out to the families of all of the children involved and especially to the two families who suffered the loss of their child. We are doing everything possible to provide support to our students, parents, and their loved ones.    The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, who went to the scene of the accident, said in a statement afterward that the accident pointed up the need to better protect pedestrians. Mr. Stringer said:   The Zip code in which 38 East Broadway is located had 25 fatalities and 1,149 injuries from 1995 to 2005, more fatalities than any other Manhattan zip code. And the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets, located just a few blocks from where today's accident occurred, is the third most dangerous location for Manhattan pedestrians. While the city has taken some important steps to manage traffic in Chinatown, including bollards, better lane designations, and other \"traffic calming\" measures, it is clear that more needs to be done, particularly given the congestion created by the continued closing of Park Row, which has been shut to most traffic since 9/11.  In New York City overall last year some 300 people were killed in traffic accidents -- nearly one person every day -- and hundreds more were injured, with children and the elderly being particularly vulnerable on our congested streets.

Here's a quick guide to help you get better acquainted.  Vudu (The Oldest Child)  What It Is: A box that lets you rent or buy movies to watch instantly on your television.  Price: $150.  Rental Fees: Renting standard-definition movies costs $1 to $4; high-definition and HDX movies (see below for explanation) cost $4 to $6. Users can also buy TV episodes for $2 and movies from $5 to $20.  Number of Titles: 14,000 movies and TV episodes, including what the company calls \"the largest HD library anywhere\" with over 1,400 movies.   The Good: Great picture quality, clean user interface and no monthly fee. Vudu delivers actual HD-quality viewing (up to 1080p) and 5.1 Dolby surround sound thanks in part to deals with Lionsgate, Paramount and Universal Studios. Vudu also offers 500 titles in HDX, a video format that has been optimized for 40-inch and larger HDTVs. But be warned: HDX download times are long -- think hours, not minutes. Users can buy movies the same day they're released on DVD.  The Bad: Erases rented movies after 24 hours, after which you have to pay $1 for a one-day extension. No built-in Wi-Fi, but a Vudu Wireless kit costs $80.  What's New: Vudu just added the Web-based music application Pandora to its collection of more than 120 Web-based video content channels, which already includes Picasa, YouTube and Flickr.  Roku (The Middle Child)  What It Is: The Roku digital video player, also known as the Netflix Player by Roku, is a box that streams Netflix and Amazon Video On Demand movies over the Internet to your television.  Price: $100.  Rental Fees: Roku requires a Netflix unlimited instant-watch account, which starts at $9. Amazon has both rental and purchase options. Rentals cost about $1 to $4. Purchases run from about $1 for TV shows and about $15 for movies.  Number of Titles: Over 50,000. (About 12,000 from Netflix and 40,000 from Amazon).  The Good: A lot of companies claim their units can be installed by a child. The Roku actually can. I was up and running in three minutes. The \"getting started\" manual is one of the simplest, most dummy-proof visual guides I've seen. The Roku also comes with built-in Wi-Fi so no adapter is needed and it's extremely compact (5.1 inches by 5.1 inches by 1.6 inches) so it won't hog your living space.  The Bad: The No. 1 gripe is its limited selection. Netflix's Instant Watch option trails Netflix's much larger DVD-by-mail catalog. My Netflix Instant Watch lists 1995's \"To Die For\" and 1998's \"The Waterboy\" among its \"new\" movie releases. By comparison, my new movie releases for the DVD-by-mail option include \"Changeling\" and \"Burn After Reading.\" I also encountered some buffering delays when I used the fast-forward/rewind controls.  What's New: This summer, Roku will release its software developer's kit for Web video providers, so expect more channels. It will also soon offer ad-supported and free content. The company is looking into online photo and music services.  Boxee (The Youngest Child)  What It Is: This service integrates and creates a single interface for the photos, music and video on your computer's hard drive. Boxee also lets users stream content from Netflix, YouTube, CNN.com and other sites for access on your television.  Price: Free.  The Good: No box needed. Downloads straight onto your desktop. Also good if you enjoy the social-networking aspect of entertainment. Boxee automatically updates your Twitter, Tumblr and FriendFeed accounts and shares your friends' activity so you can follow, recommend and find new content. The service also works on Apple TV and, because it operates on an open-source platform, allows users to personalize what they view by letting them add music and video sites.  The Bad: Have to sit through commercials. For now, Boxee is only compatible with Mac and Linux computers. Another snag: Earlier this month, the free online video service Hulu blocked the Boxee browser from accessing its site. Best case situation? The Hulu block proves to be an isolated incident. Worst case? Other companies follow suit. Also, Boxee works only on content without digital rights management. And the nontechie Boxee user will probably find configuring Linux and Apple TV difficult.  What's New: New alpha version released March 24.

The Senate has just voted to confirm former Gov. Gary Locke of Washington to the post.   Mr. Obama's first two nominees withdrew: Gov. Bill Richardson because of a pay-for-play investigation in his home state of New Mexico, and Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, over philosophical differences and a dispute about control of the Census Bureau.  But after all that controversy, Mr. Locke breezed through, with the Senate approving his nomination by voice vote. That leaves only one outstanding cabinet appointment: Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas as Health and Human Services secretary.   Senator Patty Murray, Democrat from his home state, extolled his credentials and his background tonight in endorsing him for the post. \"Governor Locke understands the importance of the American dream because he has lived it. His grandfather emigrated from China and worked as a servant just one mile from the governor's mansion in Olympia that his grandson would one day call home.\"  She also recalled a situation where he grilled her about legislation she was championing when she was in the state Senate and he was chairman of the appropriations committee.  In addition, Ms. Murray cited issues confronting the global economy, like climate change, and said: \"One of the most critical jobs the Commerce Secretary performs is finding markets for American products and technologies. Governor Locke understands how important this is \u2013 and he knows how to do it successfully. As the two-term governor of the nation's most trade-dependent state, he spent eight years breaking down trade barriers and promoting our American products \u2013 from airplanes, to apples, to operating systems.

Fortunately, Major League Baseball has provided new ways to administer the pain. We covered some of the changes in February, but here's a refresher:  MLB.TV. For an $80 season-pass, fans can watch real-time video of games outside their home media market (so New-York-area residents, for example, cannot use this to watch Yankees or Mets games on their computers.) A new premium version of the software, available for $110, offers high-definition video and a DVR-like function that lets subscribers rewind and watch the highlights. A feature called audio sync lets fans overlay their favorite radio broadcasters onto the television feed. This year, MLB is streaming games in Adobe Flash, after dumping Microsoft's Silverlight technology last year.   MLB.com At Bat 2009 for the iPhone and iPod Touch: Now available in the Apple App store for $9.99, the application offers a pitch-by-pitch game tracker, video highlights of games and Gameday Audio, which lets fans listen to live audio broadcasts of every game without any blackout restrictions. This is one way I'll be following the season--I evidently haven't learned my lesson from past Tribe disappointments--and I'm curious to measure the performance of the audio stream on AT&T's 3G network.  MLB.com Mobile Premium for BlackBerry. Available for BlackBerry Storm, Bold and Curve 8900 for $14.99 for the entire season. Much like the iPhone App, it offers Gameday Audio, pitch-by-pitch tracking, and video highlights. MLB says versions for other BlackBerry models are coming soon.

In theory.  Dell's just-announced \"premium\" computer notebook, the Adamo, starts at $2,000 and has the thin cachet. It is the first high-profile competition for the MacBook Air from Apple.  (Photo:  )   The Adamo, the subject of much speculation last year and a rather funky, if somewhat surreal, Dell demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, is 0.65 inches at its thickest point, with its guts wedged into a single piece of aluminum (did we mention MacBook?) and weighs about four pounds, about a pound more than the Air.  Adamo, which will ship later in March, is a brand as well as a piece, Dell says, and today's entry is billed as a flagship model, which means lower-priced laptops are most likely in the pipeline. You'll find all the usual component suspects here, including an Intel Core 2 Duo SU9300 processor running at 1.2GHz (fairly pedestrian performance for two large, I think), 2 gigabytes of RAM and a 128-gigabyte solid-state drive, in keeping with the current fashion for thin notebooks. Also, two USB 2.0 ports, one combo USB/eSATA port, a DisplayPort output and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.  Want an optical drive? There's none on board. It's an option, as is a Tumi carry-bag.  \"Great design needs to be timeless and evoke emotion in people,\" Alex Gruzen, senior vice president of Dell's consumer products, said in a statement. \"While a premium computing experience was assumed for Adamo, the intent was for people to see, touch and explore Adamo and be rewarded by the select materials and craftsmanship you would expect in a fine watch.\"  Well, the Adamo does tell time. But it's facing economic headwinds -- the MacBook Air has struggled to find an audience \u2014 at a time when thrifty might trump fashionable, certainly in the laptop arena. And the Mac is less ($1,799) with a faster chip. Still, if you want a Rolex, you want a Rolex.

A damaged LCD screen is typically one of the more expensive things to replace on a laptop computer. With parts and labor, it could cost north of $500 to get the screen replaced, but you should weigh the worthiness of the repair with other factors like the age and overall condition of the computer. If you opt to have a professional service replace the screen, shop around for estimates.  There are also several types of repair options available. If you prefer to drop the wounded computer off to live humans, the Geek Squad (anchored in most Best Buy stores) is among the companies that replace LCD screens.  If you have another computer to use as a backup and can go without the broken one for a while, an online mail-in repair shop might offer lower prices. The Spare Parts Warehouse, for example, does PC laptop repairs, while iResQ specializes in Mac laptops and other Apple hardware. Most online services list repair prices or have online forms you can use to request an estimate. LCDs4Less also specializes in replacement laptop screens.   If you're feeling technically adept and adventurous, you can also buy just the replacement screen from a shop such as ScreenTek and attempt to install it yourself. The Computer Shopper site lists the basic steps of LCD screen replacement, but the procedure may vary by model. ScreenTek also has a YouTube video of the process, it you want a preview of what to expect.  If even the do-it-yourself options are too expensive for you, a new laptop may be the way to go. Thanks to the influx of lightweight, low-cost Netbooks, there are more affordable options than ever before and you can find Windows XP machines for far less than $500.

Todd Peters, the vice president of marketing for the Windows Mobile division, discussed those concepts in general terms in an interview here at the Consumer Electronics Show. He declined to be more specific, explaining Microsoft plans a major announcement at the Mobile World Congress, a trade show scheduled for next month in Barcelona.  But he was clear that one way in which Microsoft plans to become more competitive is by limiting the number of devices built with the Windows Mobile operating system. At present, there are around 140 such devices, from a range of cell phone makers, from Samsung to Palm and many in between.  The reason that Microsoft is limiting the number of phones with the operating system is because, he said, the company does not want to have its efforts diluted over too many devices.  \"I'd rather have fewer devices and be more focused,\" he said. That way \"we get better integration\" between phone and operating system.  The decision by Microsoft comes as phone users are getting more discerning about the ease of use of their phones, and the breadth of capabilities. Microsoft has a particular challenge in that unlike some competitors, it does not control both the hardware and the software. By contrast, Apple designs both the hardware and software for the iPhone, while Palm today announced a new device, the Pre, and also makes the operating system, WebOS.  Mr. Peters said further details about the efforts to focus Windows will be emerge in the coming months. He said that at the Mobile World Congress--where Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, will present the keynote address--the company will talk about how it can provide more value through new touch-screen capability and new service offerings. That way, he said, companies that build phones around the Windows Mobile operating system will have an incentive to continue to pay for the software license.  \"We're going to pump more value into the license,\" he said.

After all, Advertising Age, the bible of Madison Avenue, named the Obama campaign \"Marketer of the Year\" last fall, citing in particular its ability to brand itself. Obama beat out marketing heavyweights like Apple, Nike and Coors. And that was before he got elected.  Mr. Obama's inaugural committee is now marketing a new version of the iconic \"Hope\" poster that became a phenomenon during the campaign and helped brand the candidate, certainly in the minds of the young.  The new poster was created by Shepard Fairey, the California street artist who created the original image.  He designed this one specifically for the inauguration. \"Be The Change,\" the poster instructs. It takes the now-familiar red and blue image of Mr. Obama and sets it against a backdrop of the Capitol and the White House.  Mr. Fairey created the original image with the intention that it go viral. He charged $25 to $45 for the first runs of 950 posters as a way of making enough money to print the rest, which were given away for free.  The poster went viral and beyond, to the point of being widely parodied with other single-word imperatives (\"Sleep\"). The original is now being enshrined for the ages, having been bought by Tony and Heather Podesta, lobbyists and art collectors in Washington, and gifted to the National Portrait Gallery.  Martin E. Sullivan, director of the gallery, called the poster \"an emblem of a significant election, as well as a new presidency.\" It is to go on display before Inauguration Day, on Jan. 20.  The new poster, unlike the old, is a limited edition -- and the money goes to Mr. Obama's inaugural committee.  The committee printed 10,000 copies in a single run and is selling 9,000 of them for $100 each at the committee's online inaugural store.

Includes a USB cable for programming with your laptop.  * Yahoo's Ideological Search - The search engine team at Yahoo says this new tool strips away the results from ideologically incompatible sources \"to give users only the information they want.\"  * For everyone who has exhausted the fun in karoke video games, Microsoft's XBox division offers AlpineLegend, a game that lets you yodel your way from a \"log cabin studio\" to the big \"yodel off.\" Tri-horn and goat add-ons sold separately.  * \"Millions of nanobots\" from IWantOneOfThose.com give ordinary contact lenses 4x optical zoom.  * Google's GMail adds an autopilot feature that will respond to those endless emails with words chosen tunable artificial intelligence. You can choose the number of random typos, emoticons, and capitalization to conform to your personal writing style.  * Web site owners can use the Laminatr to add a bit of shine. It includes a \"100% waterproof guarantee\" so your site will never go down again.  * Qualcomm announces plans to connect everyone and everything to the Internet whereever they go using their new \"WolfPigeon\" and \"SharkFalcon\" technology.  * Moo Tools offers a do-it-yourself business-card recycling kit that lets you paste new letters and pictures on the unwanted card that you would normally throw in the trash. Producing a pack of 50 cards is estimated to take only 20 hours.  * The Economist magazine launches a new theme park, Econoland, with thrill rides fueled by the horror of massive public debt and the imploding economy.  * ThinkGeek also offers the USB Pet Rock. \"Simply plug the USB cable into a free port and let the fun begin. \"  * Apple's iTunes is giving away a free version of the first movement from John Cage's magnum opus, 4' 33\".

The project will also highlight notable figures worth following on Twitter, anecdotes from the community and even examples of the few occasions Twitterers have gone overboard: For example, Mr. Sagolla points to \"bathroom tweets,\" or messages about bodily functions, as falling into the category of things not to post to Twitter.  \"This is a new genre of writing,\" said Mr. Sagolla. \"A new form of literature, in some ways.\"   A portion of the book will also double as a memoir from the perspective of Mr. Sagolla, who was involved in the early stages of development for the tool. Mr. Sagolla, who now works at Adobe Systems as an engineer, is also planning on including a mini-dictionary of Twitter lingo, like \"retweet,\" the reposting of another Twitterer's message, or \"twoosh,\" a message that is exactly 140 characters.  The book came about after Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sagolla met after an informal gathering of iPhone developers and began chatting about Twitter. Mr. Sagolla decided to bring Mr. Jackson, who he said updates his Twitter feed as many as 10 times an hour, into the fold.   The two expect the book to be available for download on Apple's iPhone by the end of the month. Although the plan is to eventually get a version of \"140 Characters\" in print, Mr. Sagolla said releasing the book through iTunes first would be a good way to reduce the need for a major investment upfront, as well as a springboard to attract interested publishing houses.   \"140 Characters\" isn't the first book written about the popular San Francisco, Calif., micro-blogging company. There's also \"Twitter Revolution,\" \"Twitter Means Business\" and \"Twitter for Dummies,\" for starters. But Mr. Sagolla says that while the previous publications tended to home in more on the business and money-making potential aspect of the tool, \"140 Characters\" is an attempt to create easy rules for all sorts of social networking sites, including Facebook.  \"Our goal is to make Twitter applicable to any kind of user,\" said Mr. Sagolla.

The project will also highlight notable figures worth following on Twitter, anecdotes from the community and even examples of the few occasions Twitterers have gone overboard: For example, Mr. Sagolla points to \"bathroom tweets,\" or messages about bodily functions, as falling into the category of things not to post to Twitter.  \"This is a new genre of writing,\" said Mr. Sagolla. \"A new form of literature, in some ways.\"   A portion of the book will also double as a memoir from the perspective of Mr. Sagolla, who was involved in the early stages of development for the tool. Mr. Sagolla, who now works at Adobe Systems as an engineer, is also planning on including a mini-dictionary of Twitter lingo, like \"retweet,\" the reposting of another Twitterer's message, or \"twoosh,\" a message that is exactly 140 characters.  The book came about after Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sagolla met after an informal gathering of iPhone developers and began chatting about Twitter. Mr. Sagolla decided to bring Mr. Jackson, who he said updates his Twitter feed as many as 10 times an hour, into the fold.   The two expect the book to be available for download on Apple's iPhone by the end of the month. Although the plan is to eventually get a version of \"140 Characters\" in print, Mr. Sagolla said releasing the book through iTunes first would be a good way to reduce the need for a major investment upfront, as well as a springboard to attract interested publishing houses.   \"140 Characters\" isn't the first book written about the popular San Francisco, Calif., micro-blogging company. There's also \"Twitter Revolution,\" \"Twitter Means Business\" and \"Twitter for Dummies,\" for starters. But Mr. Sagolla says that while the previous publications tended to home in more on the business and money-making potential aspect of the tool, \"140 Characters\" is an attempt to create easy rules for all sorts of social networking sites, including Facebook.  \"Our goal is to make Twitter applicable to any kind of user,\" said Mr. Sagolla.

One of the latest has a familiar name -- Detroit Electric.   Detroit Electric was a brand of the Anderson Electric Car Company at the turn of the previous century. The company went belly up in 1939, and the name Detroit Electric went the way of the Tucker. But last year a businessman with experience in the computer and automotive technology fields, mostly in Asia, revived the brand with about $300 million in capital from a host of international investors for a new electric-car company.  Last month, the new Netherlands-based Detroit Electric inked a strategic partnership -- they're all the rage these days -- with Proton, the Malaysian automaker, which also owns Lotus. Detroit Electric said it did not have a prototype, but planned to build battery-powered electric sedans and hatchbacks on Proton's assembly line outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and begin selling them in Europe by early next year. On Monday, AllCarsElectric cited a story in Ward's Auto, saying that Detroit Electric was looking for 140 to 150 dealers in the United States, where it hoped to sell cars someday.  Albert Lam is the chairman and chief executive of Detroit Electric. Before starting the company, he served as the chief executive of the Lotus Engineering Group in Britain. Before that he was the managing director of Apple Computer in Asia.  The cars will essentially be modified versions of Proton's gas-powered Persona sedan and Gen-2 hatchback with electric motors. Mr. Lam said the electric-powered Protons (i.e. Detroit Electrics) can be manufactured on the same assembly line that builds cars with gas engines. The electric motor was developed in the Netherlands, Mr. Lam said, and weighs less than 40 pounds (minus its lithium-ion-polymer battery pack) while producing the equivalent of 200 horsepower. \"You need to bring as many partners as you can\" when you want to change the car market, Mr. Lam said.  In a market set to become crowded with electric vehicles from major manufacturers and tiny upstarts, Mr. Lam said Detroit Electric would place an emphasis on \"a practical everyday electric car.\" The company's e46 and e63 models (both names will change before sales start) will be conservatively styled four-door models.

Unlike Dodgeball -- which used text messages to deliver the information and thus could be used with virtually any phone -- Latitude is an add-on to Google Maps. It relies on Google Maps' My Location feature, which uses the signals from nearby cellphone towers to plot a user's whereabouts.   That means the mobile version of Latitude can be used only on smartphones like Apple's iPhone, Research in Motion's BlackBerry and devices running Microsoft's Windows Mobile or Google's own Android operating system.  Steve Lee, product manager for Google Maps for Mobile and Google Latitude, acknowledged that limitation but said smartphone penetration had reached an \"inflection point,\" with more than 50 million Americans using them. \"We feel it's a much richer application\" than Dodgeball, he said.  Latitude also ties into the computer-based version of Google Maps through iGoogle so that, say, a husband on the move could share his location with his wife working at an office PC. (In Mr. Lee's case, his mom in the Midwest likes to check up on him. \"She can use this as a tool to see where I'm at and use it for peace of mind,\" he said.)  Besides broadcasting their locations, Latitude users can call, text or chat with their online friends and update their status messages. Google said the mobile version of the service is available in 27 countries.  (Photo: )   Privacy is a key concern with any kind of location-based social networking service, and Google says Latitude is completely opt-in: Users choose who gets access and what level of information they can see. For example, users could grant close friends and family access to their exact location, while limiting acquaintances to knowing only the city they're in. And for those moments when you need to go into total stealth mode, the application allows you to manually set your location or cloak it entirely.   It's still unclear how much people need or want to send this kind of location information to friends and acquaintances. Dodgeball was never more than a tiny niche application, and its rivals, Loopt and Brightkite, also have yet to build a large user base.

(Photo: ) The bulk of the book, titled \"140 Characters, A Style Guide for the Short Form,\" will revolve around eight key lessons from the Twitter universe, such as the importance of simplicity, honesty and humor. The project will also highlight notable figures worth following on Twitter, anecdotes from the community and even examples of the few occasions Twitterers have gone overboard: For example, Mr. Sagolla points to \"bathroom tweets,\" or messages about bodily functions, as falling into the category of things not to post to Twitter.  \"This is a new genre of writing,\" said Mr. Sagolla. \"A new form of literature, in some ways.\"   A portion of the book will also double as a memoir from the perspective of Mr. Sagolla, who was involved in the early stages of development for the tool. Mr. Sagolla, who now works at Adobe Systems as an engineer, is also planning on including a mini-dictionary of Twitter lingo, like \"retweet,\" the reposting of another Twitterer's message, or \"twoosh,\" a message that is exactly 140 characters.  The book came about after Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sagolla met after an informal gathering of iPhone developers and began chatting about Twitter. Mr. Sagolla decided to bring Mr. Jackson, who he said updates his Twitter feed as many as 10 times an hour, into the fold.   The two expect the book to be available for download on Apple's iPhone by the end of the month. Although the plan is to eventually get a version of \"140 Characters\" in print, Mr. Sagolla said releasing the book through iTunes first would be a good way to reduce the need for a major investment upfront, as well as a springboard to attract interested publishing houses.   \"140 Characters\" isn't the first book written about the popular San Francisco, Calif., micro-blogging company. There's also \"Twitter Revolution,\" \"Twitter Means Business\" and \"Twitter for Dummies,\" for starters. But Mr. Sagolla says that while the previous publications tended to home in more on the business and money-making potential aspect of the tool, \"140 Characters\" is an attempt to create easy rules for all sorts of social networking sites, including Facebook.  \"Our goal is to make Twitter applicable to any kind of user,\" said Mr. Sagolla.

Later on Tuesday, Mr. Perlman, a Silicon Valley veteran who is a former principal scientist at Apple and the founder of WebTV, will unveil his new company, OnLive, which he says has the potential to radically transform the $46 billion worldwide video game market.  When it begins operations later this year, OnLive will offer subscribers a selection of video games that are hosted online and can be played on at any time, on any television or computer \u2014 Macintosh or PC \u2014 including low-cost computers without sophisticated graphics chips. (To play on the TV, people will need a small, hand-size micro-console, which OnLive says it may give away free.)  Rapid-fire shoot-em-ups like Electronic Arts' Crysis, normally playable only by people with high-end gaming computers, will be available to everyone, Mr. Perlman says, and \"it will feel like the games are being played locally.\"  Game publishers including EA, Take Two Interactive, Warner Brothers, THQ and Eidos, among others, have signed on to provide games, and because of the flexibility that comes with hosting titles online, they can experiment with incentives, like free trials, and new business models, like game rentals.   Mr. Perlman says he has been quietly working on OnLive for the last seven years, trying to perfect the video compression algorithms. The company, which was spun out of Rearden, his technology incubator, now has 100 employees in Palo Alto and San Francisco and around 100 patents related to cloud-based gaming.  If it works -- and it seems as if that will heavily depend on whether the technology provides a satisfying, lag-free experience for the most intense games -- Mr. Perlman says it will undermine the $20 billion market for hardware like Xbox, PlayStation and Wii consoles.  He also says hosting games in the cloud can cut out video game retailers, who are punishing the profit margins for video game publishers, and destroy piracy and the secondary market for used games. Cloud-based gaming could also conceivably relieve consumers from ever having to upgrade their gaming hardware again.  But gamers will no doubt reserve judgment until they are playing Crysis against a stranger across the country on a lower-end machine. OnLive will formally introduce itself Tuesday night at the Game Developer's Conference that is being held this week in San Francisco.

If you have ever walked by a building in the borough and wondered about its origins, or whether a historic event really took place where you think it did, or any other little-known fact, they will know the answers. Both in their book and on their guided tours, the authors try to link the history of Manhattan to places that can still be visited today. One of their goals is to focus on the patterns that emerge as a neighborhood or street changes over time. Readers who would like to ask the authors a question should do so in the comments box below. The first set of answers will be published on Wednesday.  Like many New Yorkers, Michelle and James Nevius both originally hail from elsewhere. Michelle was born and raised in Baltimore, and James lived in spots around the world as diverse as Saudi Arabia, Italy and Utah.  They met in college (though technically, in different colleges - Michelle at Columbia, where she was working on a degree in art history and archaeology, and James at New York University, where he studied English and American literature) and began exploring the city together. What started as a hobby soon became a passion and, ultimately, a vocation.  While pursuing her graduate degrees at Columbia (from which she holds two master's degrees), Michelle taught art history to Columbia undergraduates and at Hunter College. Her studies eventually brought her to focus on the art and architecture of New York City. James's interest in the city's past began as a personal one: he is a Knickerbocker (a descendant of the original Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam) and an 11th-generation New Yorker. One ancestor, Johannes Nevius, was the last city secretary of New Amsterdam and, after the English takeover, the first secretary of New York. Another ancestor, Johannes Polhemus, was the pastor of the first church in Brooklyn.  Michelle Nevius Tours was begun in 2000 to provide in-depth tours of New York City neighborhoods. Four itineraries (Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, Central Park and the Lower East Side) soon expanded to cover most of the island of Manhattan, from Harlem to the financial district, as well as Brooklyn Heights. Every tour is a mix of architecture, history, art and culture, with a focus on uncovering hidden history and pointing out intriguing facts and stories along the way that may not be readily apparent to the casual visitor.  Michelle and James are also the authors of \"Frommer's 24 Great Walks in New York\" (known in Europe as \"New York: History & Mystery\").

If you have ever walked by a building in the borough and wondered about its origins, or whether a historic event really took place where you think it did, or any other little-known fact, they will know the answers. Both in their book and on their guided tours, the authors try to link the history of Manhattan to places that can still be visited today. One of their goals is to focus on the patterns that emerge as a neighborhood or street changes over time. Readers who would like to ask the authors a question should do so in the comments box below. The first set of answers will be published on Wednesday.  Like many New Yorkers, Michelle and James Nevius both originally hail from elsewhere. Michelle was born and raised in Baltimore, and James lived in spots around the world as diverse as Saudi Arabia, Italy and Utah.  They met in college (though technically, in different colleges - Michelle at Columbia, where she was working on a degree in art history and archaeology, and James at New York University, where he studied English and American literature) and began exploring the city together. What started as a hobby soon became a passion and, ultimately, a vocation.  While pursuing her graduate degrees at Columbia (from which she holds two master's degrees), Michelle taught art history to Columbia undergraduates and at Hunter College. Her studies eventually brought her to focus on the art and architecture of New York City. James's interest in the city's past began as a personal one: he is a Knickerbocker (a descendant of the original Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam) and an 11th-generation New Yorker. One ancestor, Johannes Nevius, was the last city secretary of New Amsterdam and, after the English takeover, the first secretary of New York. Another ancestor, Johannes Polhemus, was the pastor of the first church in Brooklyn.  Michelle Nevius Tours was begun in 2000 to provide in-depth tours of New York City neighborhoods. Four itineraries (Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, Central Park and the Lower East Side) soon expanded to cover most of the island of Manhattan, from Harlem to the financial district, as well as Brooklyn Heights. Every tour is a mix of architecture, history, art and culture, with a focus on uncovering hidden history and pointing out intriguing facts and stories along the way that may not be readily apparent to the casual visitor.  Michelle and James are also the authors of \"Frommer's 24 Great Walks in New York\" (known in Europe as \"New York: History & Mystery\").

(Photo:  ) Mobicip, a start-up based in southern California, is one of the companies trying to tackle that issue head on. The company provides a free, kid-safe browser for iPhones and iPod Touches. Mobicip's browser works exactly like Safari, but bars access to Web sites containing sexually explicit material, graphic violence, Web-based chat clients, e-commerce, social networks and games.   But simply monitoring for domain names isn't enough to keep curious eyes away from illicit content, said Suren Ramasubbu, founder and chief executive of Mobicip.  \"Kids are so savvy these days, it's really easy to get around domain-based filters,\" said Mr. Ramasubbu.   To that end, Mobicip employs a custom-built algorithm that screens phrases and metadata embedded in Web pages to determine if content is appropriate for young Web surfers.   Parents also have the option of adjusting the level of restriction by age group. Mr. Ramasubbu said the company planned to release a premium version of Mobicip for $9.99 that lets parents see which Web sites are being visited.   Another program, iWonder Surf, available for download for $14.99, performs a function similar to Mobicip, but the remote access is more fleshed out, allowing parents the ability to block and unblock sites at their leisure. With iWonder Surf, parents can see which Web sites are being visited, and in the case of some social networks, like MySpace, find out which profiles their children have viewed.  Safe Eyes Mobile, available for $19.99, is another application that controls access. Safe Eyes Mobile, like its desktop brother, tracks Web history and sends e-mail notifications to parents when Web surfers try to gain access to restricted Web sites. In addition, Safe Eyes Mobile lets parents set limits on browsing time.  Mr. Ramasubbu says applications like Mobicip and Safe Eyes Mobile are just the first step toward keeping kids from stumbling onto explicit sites.  \"Parents have to keep an eye on the sites their kids are visiting and talk to them about their behavior,\" he said.   So far, Mobicip is gaining some traction: the application has been downloaded 3,500 times since it was released in February. \"We get a lot of fan mail from parents and a lot of hate mail from the kids,\" said Mr. Ramasubbu.

The Internet companies are among a variety of companies eyed as potential Dow replacements, a diverse list that also includes former investment bank Goldman Sachs and former Dow star U.S. Steel.  In recent weeks, six stocks on the Dow have tumbled below $10 and on Friday Citigroup, once the world's most valuable bank, sunk to 97 cents.  Analysts say Citigroup and automaker General Motors are most likely to be replaced. Despite billions in government aid, both trade below $2 and serve as symbols of Wall Street's corporate excess.  The Dow has shed roughly 25 percent of its value in 2009, a drop that has prompted analysts to call for an update of an index that many say has been out-of-date for years.  \"I don't have much interaction with Exxon Mobil, but I'm on Google 47 times a day,\" Barry Ritholtz, chief market strategist of Fusion IQ in New York, told Reuters. Exxon is one of the 30 stocks listed on the Dow. \"Indirectly that means I'm interfacing with the plumbing of Cisco,\" he told the news service.  Other candidates include high-profile household names such as the world's largest credit card network, Visa, or the maker of the iPod, Apple.  \"Some have said that Visa, because of its strong brand name and relatively large market capitalization of almost $42 billion, might be a possible replacement for Citi,\" Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut, told Reuters.  But there is little consensus about the size and sector of company that should be in the Dow. Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, argues that smaller companies like Aflac or Northern Trust \"fit into the category of good representation, well-run companies. They're just not high profile.\"  A materials company might be well-suited to be a part of the Dow rather than another financial stock, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Part of the debate stems from confusion about what the index actually represents.  \"Does it represent the largest and best companies in the U.S.?\" Mr. Nolte, based in Hinsdale, Illinois, told Reuters. \"If so, I think you can probably argue that a third of the companies should probably go.  \"But if you want to say they represent various industries and replicate what is going on in the U.S. economy -- it's doing that under current conditions.\"  Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times>> ", "abstract": "The Internet companies are among a variety of companies eyed as potential Dow replacements, a diverse list that also includes former investment bank Goldman Sachs and former Dow star U.S. Steel.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Google and Cisco Eyed as Possible Dow Candidates", "kicker": "DealBook", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Google and Cisco Eyed as Possible Dow Candidates", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2009-03-10T10:33:52+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/280cae34-00d2-546c-92aa-1cd1e82e1afc", "word_count": 437, "uri": "nyt://article/280cae34-00d2-546c-92aa-1cd1e82e1afc"}, {"web_url": "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/michael-j-homer-netscape-executive-dies-at-50/", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "Michael J.

(Photo: Jan Cobb) )   This week, John Hodgman, the \"resident expert\" on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" and the author of \"More Information Than You Require,\" will be answering selected readers' questions about life as an author, famous minor television personality and a man who wears glasses in New York. Readers who would like to ask Mr. Hodgman a question within the areas of his expertise (for example, Brooklyn inventions, the names of mole-men and how to cook an owl, among other topics) should do so in the comments box below. Since this is a New York blog, City Room would appreciate it if you would put a New York spin on it. (For example: How do I cook an owl in Brooklyn?) The first set of answers will be posted on Wednesday.   As he tells it, before he went on television, Mr. Hodgman was a simple writer, expert and former professional literary agent living in New York City. In this capacity, he has served as the humor editor for The New York Times Magazine, occasional public radio personality for \"This American Life,\" advice columnist for McSweeney's, and a freelance journalist specializing in food, nonwine alcohol, \"Battlestar Galactica\" and most other subjects. In addition, he was the founder of the Little Gray Book Lectures in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This, he says, was enough of a career for any human.  But then he wrote a satirical and almost wholly false book of \"complete world knowledge\" titled \"The Areas of My Expertise\" and was asked to appear on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\" where he continues to provide commentary as the fake-news show's \"resident expert.\"   Now, at 37, Mr. Hodgman has unexpectedly become -- in his words -- a famous minor television personality, appearing as the PC in the \"Get a Mac\" series of ads for Apple computers, and accepting guest roles as \"the person wearing glasses\" in a variety of films and television shows, including \"Battlestar Galactica,\" a show he once wrote about as a journalist. He is also a Ted.com-certified geek and Internet celebrity, having guest-blogged at BoingBoing, appeared on numerous podcasts and established a Twitter following of more than 26,000 people. He recently completed a book tour with the Brooklyn musician Jonathan Coulton.  Mr. Hodgman, a native of Brookline, Mass., attended Yale and lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He says that from time to time, he is asked to describe his professional life, and in particular the effect of this remarkable and surprising change of fortune, and typically, he finds he cannot do it.   As always, we ask that readers restrict comments on this feature to questions for our guest, until after the first round of answers.

(Photo: David Goldman for the New York Times)) For now, New York's newest wets are still dry, and maybe that is just as well. This brother-and-sister team plans to spend Friday celebrating the 90th anniversary of the ratification of the 18th Amendment, which, if they had been alive back then, would have deprived them of what they want most: a drink. A little vodka, thank you very much.  Using the name Prohibition Distillery, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Walsh and Dianne Walsh plan to start making hard liquor. No, not in a bathtub, but with German-made equipment they say they have installed in Southold, N.Y. That is on the north fork of Long Island, which, Mr. Walsh noted, was a haven for bootleggers until the 21st Amendment undid Prohibition.    (Nor is Mr. Walsh, 43, related to those Kennedys. So why his name? He said that his mother learned soon after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, in 1963, that she was pregnant, and decided that if she had a son\u2014well, you get the idea.)  About a year ago, the Walshes decided to strike out on their own. Mr. Walsh is a former investment banker and former executive with the payroll corporation ADP; Ms. Walsh had bought and sold real estate in New Jersey, where they live. They did some brainstorming and decided that what consumers needed was domestic vodka, gin and bourbon.  \"A lot of the vodkas now are made in Europe,\" Ms. Walsh said. \"It's time to have made-in-America products, and I believe in the 100-mile-radius concept.\"  So the ingredients for their vodka \u2014 potatoes, apples, corn and tomatoes, she said \u2014 will be grown on farms in the New York region. There are still some potato farms on the eastern end of Long Island, the Walshes said, even though many have been turned into wineries or, before the real estate market soured, into weekend palaces for the second-home crowd.   \"Vodka is not rocket science,\" Mr. Walsh said. \"It's a pretty easy product to produce with the right people. That's why we wanted to come out with the vodka first. It's a product we can manage pretty early and lead into the gins and the bourbons, which take a little more time.\"  But they will not have a batch ready when they announce their plans this morning on the steps of Federal Hall in Lower Manhattan, a location they chose for the symbolism: After all, Prohibition amounted to a federally mandated sobering-up, with federal agents hunting down stills and wrecking speakeasies. The Walshes hope to have some vodka for tastings in the spring.  Then, after recovering from that hangover, they will get started on making their gin in time for the anniversary of the end of Prohibition, on Dec. 5.

Nor is drinking it. In America, most spirits are consumed as part of a cocktail, and most cocktails are designed to hide the less-than-elegant character of the cheaper spirits commonly used in mixed drinks. My distillations, bottled at 80 proof, and bone dry and containing only the spirit of the fruit, are often shocking to people who have been drinking spirits for decades but have never actually tasted what they are drinking.   To make matters even more perilous, my distillations are expensive. It takes about 30 pounds of pears to make one 750 milliliter bottle of eau de vie of poire. So my suggested retail price of $39.95 per bottle (of which I keep less than half after taxes and discounts for distribution) leaves me precious little room to cover costs and maybe make a bit of profit. At the same time even my best customers can be discouraged by what they see as a fairly expensive bottle.   If you are drinking an artisan distillation, you are drinking the history of a people, of a region, and of what they grow. But there is an issue beyond \u2014 and probably more intractable than \u2014 price. Our busy lives (and the need for restaurants to turn tables) make life tough for an eau de vie. Historically these spirits were taken at the dinner table as a digestive at the end of a long, leisurely meal. Think back: How many of those have you had recently? Maybe one a month, if you're lucky.  But that's why I love eau de vie. I like to have it \u2014 maybe an ounce or an ounce and a half -- at the table, surrounded by good friends (as few as one will do nicely) after a wonderful meal that was accompanied by a glass or two of good wine. The conversation that takes place at those times, the experience of talking about family legends and political figures, are in fact part of eau de vie.  I have always felt that if you are drinking an artisan distillation, you are drinking the history of a people, of a region, and of what they grow. Every product I have developed \u2014 about 23 over the last 25 years \u2014 has had a specific European ancestor. In 1961, when I was a student in France, I joined the Grenoble Universit\u00e9 Montagne, the mountain climbing club, and climbed in the Alps that spring. Some fairly mediocre eau de vie helped me to go to sleep at night in crowded huts in the Alps. (I remember the good eau de vie as well as the bad.) I know the best Kirschwasser I ever had, a bottle of 10-year-old Swiss Kirsch from Dettling Distillery. The best eau de vie of pear by Ova Distillers of Switzerland. Barrel aged apple brandy \u2014 an obscure Calvados. A product that all conceivable market research would say had absolutely no future is now a modest success, which is pretty good for something made out of a fir tree.   I have respected these products and the people who made them. These were not developed in some factory laboratory somewhere, but 200 years ago in the barns of peasants who were trying to find a way to use the pears that the pigs would no longer eat. And by and large I have not departed from European traditions in my efforts to duplicate what the French and the Germans and the Swiss and the Italians developed. Those people know a lot. Now, maybe, I am taking small liberties in fermentation and distillation. But only because, I think, I have earned the right to do so. And only because the results are better than my earlier efforts, and maybe, sometimes, better than what the Europeans make. I see all of this too, I think, in a few other small distillers of eau de vie who have a long track record of steadily improving offerings, and who now feel free \u2014 correctly \u2014 to nudge their products away from their ancestry. Try the Aqua Perfecta eau de vie from St. George distillery, for example. Totally accomplished and in character but also clearly American. Or the magical alembic distillations of Germain-Robin, from Ukiah, Calif.   Twenty years ago in Colmar, France, I bought a bottle of eau de vie de bourgeons de sapin d'Alsace, made from the buds of the spruce tree and one of the more obscure eau de vie in the world. I started to work on an Oregon version of the same product, using the Douglas Fir, the iconic conifer of the Pacific Northwest.  Each year, we took barrels of high proof Oregon wine distillates to our forest on the north side of Mount Hood in Oregon. We walked out into the woods and picked hundreds of pounds of the bright green buds and dropped them directly into stainless steel buckets full of that high proof wine distillate. We took the strange brew back to Portland, let the needles soak and then distilled the stew of fir buds and needles in our pot stills. I struggled with getting the intense spring conifer aroma of the Douglas Fir, the citrus flavor, and the emerald green/chartreuse color of the buds to reveal themselves in the same batch. We'd get the color we wanted, but not the aroma; or we'd get the color, but at raw distilled proof (160 proof) a strength that made it undrinkable. And when we brought the proof down, we would lose the color.  This went on for 15 years, and I suspected that my wonderful employees were saying things about me that I really did not want to hear. Then, a couple of years ago, with the help of a new employee, Daniel Ruiz, we finally got flavor, color and aroma to come together at 95.46 proof. We have a beautiful light green, ridiculously aromatic, robust eau de vie of Douglas Fir. A product that all conceivable market research would say had absolutely no future is now a modest success in the market place, which is pretty good for something made out of a fir tree.   In the last 25 years, we have learned that there is a market for our eau de vie in North America. These people want the pure taste of an eau de vie. They don't mind that it is strong. That is what they want. And they don't mind that it is not sweet. That's what they want, too. And so, for us, that's where the glory is: capturing the pure aroma and complex flavor of the Douglas Fir, the Mirabelle plum or the Loganberry, the apple and, of course, the pear.   The next impossible challenge? The insanely tart Oregon cranberry. Let's hope it doesn't take another 15 years.

Nor is drinking it. In America, most spirits are consumed as part of a cocktail, and most cocktails are designed to hide the less-than-elegant character of the cheaper spirits commonly used in mixed drinks. My distillations, bottled at 80 proof, and bone dry and containing only the spirit of the fruit, are often shocking to people who have been drinking spirits for decades but have never actually tasted what they are drinking.   To make matters even more perilous, my distillations are expensive. It takes about 30 pounds of pears to make one 750 milliliter bottle of eau de vie of poire. So my suggested retail price of $39.95 per bottle (of which I keep less than half after taxes and discounts for distribution) leaves me precious little room to cover costs and maybe make a bit of profit. At the same time even my best customers can be discouraged by what they see as a fairly expensive bottle.   If you are drinking an artisan distillation, you are drinking the history of a people, of a region, and of what they grow. But there is an issue beyond \u2014 and probably more intractable than \u2014 price. Our busy lives (and the need for restaurants to turn tables) make life tough for an eau de vie. Historically these spirits were taken at the dinner table as a digestive at the end of a long, leisurely meal. Think back: How many of those have you had recently? Maybe one a month, if you're lucky.  But that's why I love eau de vie. I like to have it \u2014 maybe an ounce or an ounce and a half -- at the table, surrounded by good friends (as few as one will do nicely) after a wonderful meal that was accompanied by a glass or two of good wine. The conversation that takes place at those times, the experience of talking about family legends and political figures, are in fact part of eau de vie.  I have always felt that if you are drinking an artisan distillation, you are drinking the history of a people, of a region, and of what they grow. Every product I have developed \u2014 about 23 over the last 25 years \u2014 has had a specific European ancestor. In 1961, when I was a student in France, I joined the Grenoble Universit\u00e9 Montagne, the mountain climbing club, and climbed in the Alps that spring. Some fairly mediocre eau de vie helped me to go to sleep at night in crowded huts in the Alps. (I remember the good eau de vie as well as the bad.) I know the best Kirschwasser I ever had, a bottle of 10-year-old Swiss Kirsch from Dettling Distillery. The best eau de vie of pear by Ova Distillers of Switzerland. Barrel aged apple brandy \u2014 an obscure Calvados. A product that all conceivable market research would say had absolutely no future is now a modest success, which is pretty good for something made out of a fir tree.   I have respected these products and the people who made them. These were not developed in some factory laboratory somewhere, but 200 years ago in the barns of peasants who were trying to find a way to use the pears that the pigs would no longer eat. And by and large I have not departed from European traditions in my efforts to duplicate what the French and the Germans and the Swiss and the Italians developed. Those people know a lot. Now, maybe, I am taking small liberties in fermentation and distillation. But only because, I think, I have earned the right to do so. And only because the results are better than my earlier efforts, and maybe, sometimes, better than what the Europeans make. I see all of this too, I think, in a few other small distillers of eau de vie who have a long track record of steadily improving offerings, and who now feel free \u2014 correctly \u2014 to nudge their products away from their ancestry. Try the Aqua Perfecta eau de vie from St. George distillery, for example. Totally accomplished and in character but also clearly American. Or the magical alembic distillations of Germain-Robin, from Ukiah, Calif.   Twenty years ago in Colmar, France, I bought a bottle of eau de vie de bourgeons de sapin d'Alsace, made from the buds of the spruce tree and one of the more obscure eau de vie in the world. I started to work on an Oregon version of the same product, using the Douglas Fir, the iconic conifer of the Pacific Northwest.  Each year, we took barrels of high proof Oregon wine distillates to our forest on the north side of Mount Hood in Oregon. We walked out into the woods and picked hundreds of pounds of the bright green buds and dropped them directly into stainless steel buckets full of that high proof wine distillate. We took the strange brew back to Portland, let the needles soak and then distilled the stew of fir buds and needles in our pot stills. I struggled with getting the intense spring conifer aroma of the Douglas Fir, the citrus flavor, and the emerald green/chartreuse color of the buds to reveal themselves in the same batch. We'd get the color we wanted, but not the aroma; or we'd get the color, but at raw distilled proof (160 proof) a strength that made it undrinkable. And when we brought the proof down, we would lose the color.  This went on for 15 years, and I suspected that my wonderful employees were saying things about me that I really did not want to hear. Then, a couple of years ago, with the help of a new employee, Daniel Ruiz, we finally got flavor, color and aroma to come together at 95.46 proof. We have a beautiful light green, ridiculously aromatic, robust eau de vie of Douglas Fir. A product that all conceivable market research would say had absolutely no future is now a modest success in the market place, which is pretty good for something made out of a fir tree.   In the last 25 years, we have learned that there is a market for our eau de vie in North America. These people want the pure taste of an eau de vie. They don't mind that it is strong. That is what they want. And they don't mind that it is not sweet. That's what they want, too. And so, for us, that's where the glory is: capturing the pure aroma and complex flavor of the Douglas Fir, the Mirabelle plum or the Loganberry, the apple and, of course, the pear.   The next impossible challenge? The insanely tart Oregon cranberry. Let's hope it doesn't take another 15 years.

Two manuals covered high-end flat-panel TVs, and two were for Blu-ray players that I'm evaluating. I won't mention the company names because the issues I found I've seen from other manufacturers as well.  The manuals were interesting not for what was in them, but for what was left out. While this may not affect the average viewer who may be happy simply plugging in a TV and watching whatever comes out, a consumer who has purchased a Blu-ray player along with an expensive set may be looking for the ultimate picture quality that the components are capable of delivering.  All too often, however, the instructions that could help you achieve that goal fall short. For instance, both companies' Blu-ray products offer picture adjustments that duplicate those found on the matching TVs: one has white adjust, black adjust, hue and color level. The corresponding TV lets you change black level, gamma, clear white, white balance and color space. Similar settings were available from the other model as well.  One model lets you change the Blu-ray player's output to 24p, for a more film-like look. But then you need to alter the TV's output to a frequency that will match the Blu-ray player's, but that's not explained.  Similar problems arise when trying to decipher which input to use. One manual instructs users to select the RGB (0-255) output \"when connecting to an RGB (0-255) device.\" How many people know what this means?  I had the opportunity to discuss some of these issues today with the head of technical training for a major consumer electronics company. He pointed out that duplicative picture adjustments are placed on multiple devices because a company doesn't know what components a consumer will use; it's possible that someone could connect an older TV to a newer disc player (although I doubt that any owner of a Blu-ray player would use any TV but the latest 1080p set).  His recommendation: adjust the TV controls first, and only then tweak those of a disc player.  But surely all of these variables could be discussed and anticipated by manufacturers who could point out what every control did, when to use it, and when to ignore it.  Apple tackled this problem years ago, not only by creating an operating system that was more intuitive than the competition's, but also by writing manuals that were easy to understand and answered consumers' questions before they even knew they wanted to ask them.  As digital televisions and video and audio components become almost as complex to use as PCs, it's time for the consumer electronics industry to create instructions that help simplify the process, rather than leaving customers scratching their heads in confusion.

The Beat has amassed both a startling amount of attention and a truly devoted following, and it's not difficult to understand why. It is a nicely avant-garde scent - nicely in the sense that it is smartly and carefully positioned at that pendulum point where the refreshingly different and startling meets the accessibly commercial. To phrase it differently, the Beat manages a bit of edginess without actually being provocative (like the brilliant Gucci Envy), neuronally overwhelming (Angel, Outrageous) or disorientingly strange (most anything by Comme des Garcons).
