Their partnership produced bold foreign policy advances like the opening of relations with China in 1971-72, but also prolonged and expanded the Vietnam War and overthrew the democratically elected government of Chile.

The promotion, to be announced today, is also intended to push customers to use Starbucks\u2019s Wi-Fi network, which allows free access to iTunes, but requires payment for regular Web access. Customers, however, do not have to visit iTunes from inside Starbucks to redeem the cards, which will be valid until the end of the year.
