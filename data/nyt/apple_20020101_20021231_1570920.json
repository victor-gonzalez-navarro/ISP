Hand-formed, yeast or cake dough, filled with jellies or homemade custard, rolled in cinnamon sugar or glazed -- these creations, all fried in Wesson oil -- are worth blowing a diet. Hoffman's is to doughnuts what Peter Luger's is to steak: a mecca, a throwback and an out-of-the-way spot to enjoy something really good. Thirty-eight years ago, Carl Hoffman bought this doughnut shop from the Grimm family. Before he died, he passed the business on to his son Clint, better known as Red, who now works with his son, Mark. Not too much has changed. Frying begins at 4:30 a.m. Choices include the knot cruller (65 cents); the cinnamon sugar-dusted jelly stick (90 cents); the coffee roll, a yeast bread studded with raisins, laced with cinnamon and deep fried (85 cents); and apple or strawberry turnovers (90 cents, available only on Fridays and Saturdays).

When Isabel was 14, on the night of her Carnegie Hall debut, her parents died in a car crash. She hasn't played well since. She awakens on the book's first page in a Milan hotel to discover that her septuagenarian lover, the only person who remembers her illustrious past, has died. Stranded in Italy with no family, little money and an exceedingly delicate temperament (she finds the crunching required to eat an apple unendurably violent), Isabel proceeds to make a series of mysterious and haphazard choices. She begins an uneasy romance with a surgical resident who sidelines as a gigolo, and takes work tutoring a troubled adolescent boy with a taste for dog biscuits. The boy's father owns an exquisite 16th-century cello, the same instrument, Isabel suspects, that was confiscated by the Nazis from a famous Jewish musician. Isabel is powerfully drawn to the cello, which, like her, hasn't made music in years. The Holocaust casts its long shadow over them both: Isabel's father, a pianist and a concentration camp survivor, has left his daughter a legacy of crushing anxiety. When she was a child, he told her ''that bad people crumbled if they heard Beethoven or Bach,'' and that only her musical virtuosity would protect her. The novel is breathless, opaque and hard to track; it is also singular and sometimes haunting.

For at one end of Paterson Plank Road is an unexpected oasis known as the Waterfront Cafe, Driving Range and Marina. On a lovely Thursday evening, my friend Fiona and I took the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission's fantastic boat tour of the ever-improving Hackensack River. The journey begins and ends at the cafe's marina. Though not far from our Manhattan workplace, we felt as though we were on vacation in a laid-back seaside town. After the boat trip, we dined at the cafe's outdoor Tiki Bar, while a three-piece band played in the parking lot. Our appetizer was Claudia's spicy shrimp ($8.95 for five), coated in a delicious soy-based sauce. For entrees, Fiona enjoyed the Waterfront burger ($5.95 with fries) while I wolfed down the chicken parmigiana ($12.95 with linguine). Topping off a terrific night, we played a round of mini golf ($5 per person) at the cafe's charming 17-hole course. I marveled at Fiona's mastery of the back eight. Nine days later, on a dreary Saturday, I brought my parents to the Waterfront Cafe. We opted for the casual but tasteful dining room. (The second floor is available for catered parties.) Mom went for the chicken marsala ($12.95), Dad selected a daily special, pork chops in an apple raisin sauce ($15.95), and I tried the eight-ounce filet mignon ($16.95). The portions were generous, the food nicely prepared, and all of the entrees came with salad, potat, and vegetables. Meanwhile, my dad mercilessly quizzed a waitress about the olive oil, and Mom was pleased to hear Billy Joel's ''Captain Jack'' on the dining room speakers. Minutes from the madness of Routes 3 and 17, what a pleasure to find a peaceful place equally fine for Fiona or the folks.

Beginning with ''Band of Brothers,'' in 1992, and continuing, at the spectacular clip of about a book a year, through last year's ''Wild Blue,'' he offered his male readership, their schedules full to bursting with P.T.A. meetings and obligatory attendance at soccer games, a powerful image of men as they used to be.", "abstract": "Anthony Giardina remembers historian Stephen Ambrose, who died in 2002; photo (M)", "print_page": "52", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Branding Brotherhood", "kicker": "THE LIVES THEY LIVED", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THE LIVES THEY LIVED; Branding Brotherhood", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "AMBROSE, STEPHEN", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Biographical Information", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2002-12-29T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "section_name": "Magazine", "byline": {"original": "By Anthony Giardina", "person": [{"firstname": "Anthony", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Giardina", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/70fe365b-bf2c-528f-ac4e-8a8959ca73fa", "word_count": 887, "uri": "nyt://article/70fe365b-bf2c-528f-ac4e-8a8959ca73fa"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/nyregion/dining-out-a-well-worn-path-to-french-country-fare.html", "snippet": "Alice Gabriel reviews La Cremaillere restaurant in Banksville, NY; photos (M)", "lead_paragraph": "LA CR\u00c9MAILL\u00c8RE fits seamlessly into the neighborhood in this tiny hamlet halfway between Greenwich and Bedford, a well-preserved dowager with genteel manners and a history of facelifts.", "abstract": "Alice Gabriel reviews La Cremaillere restaurant in Banksville, NY; photos (M)", "print_page": "14", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Dining Out; A Well-Worn Path to French Country Fare", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Dining Out; A Well-Worn Path to French Country Fare", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "La Cremaillere", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Reviews", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Restaurants", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2002-05-26T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Westchester Weekly Desk", "section_name": "New York", "byline": {"original": "By Alice Gabriel", "person": [{"firstname": "Alice", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Gabriel", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/a3508d7c-f1c9-5b0d-96f9-b61009de32f9", "word_count": 917, "uri": "nyt://article/a3508d7c-f1c9-5b0d-96f9-b61009de32f9"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/style/shaken-and-stirred-sake-goes-clubbing.html", "snippet": "Shaken and Stirred column on sake; recipe from New York's Remedy Lounge and Restaurant; photo (M)", "lead_paragraph": "I ASSOCIATE sake with two-handed sipping and head-bowing ceremony, not a harmonica-happy Stevie Wonder mix.

The chef, Orlando Le\u00f3n, left, gives a nod to his native Colombia in Agua de Panela, made with a dark, molasseslike brown sugar paste called panela dissolved in hot water with cinnamon, cloves and ginger, and topped with whipped cream. Latin Apple, a mixture of warm apple cider and dulce de leche, is crowned with whipped cream drizzled with more dulce de leche. For an easy home version, just heat cider in a saucepan and add dulce de leche to taste.

It's also an invitation to a tiny, friendly cafe and creperie with flavors of France and the Middle East. Stopping there while waiting for a commuter bus on a recent morning, I tried a lemon crepe ($3.50) so light and intensely lemony, the memory lingered for days and drew me back again and again. The other crepe offerings, like cinnamon apple ($4.50) or ham, cheese and mushrooms ($6.50) have their appeal and tabouleh salad ($5.50) or a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich are better suited for lunch, but that simple lemon crepe is my new breakfast ideal. And for commuters heading for a bus or train, it's more portable than a crepe loaded down with chunks of strawberry or apple. Mike and DiDi Tuma opened the cafe in early December, encouraged by the raves their crepes drew at a festival in Montclair last year. Every Sunday from last April through September, they sold crepes at festivals, working 18- to 20-hour days. With a young daughter, they wanted a routine. Raised in Nazareth, Israel, Mr. Tuma has worked at a string of restaurants. His mother used to make crepes for him, he said, but he recognized their commercial potential on trips to Paris. ''They have crepes on the street, and people carry them along,'' he said. He spreads batter into a thin circle on a special round griddle, adds the filling and folds it into a rectangle. The sweet crepes get a dusting of powdered sugar and perhaps a drizzle of sauce. That seductive lemon flavor is nothing more than fresh lemon, squeezed over the crepe's warm, eggy surface.

''What do you get -- soup, rolls, and the check?'' Yes, an early bird special at elegant Amanda's, no joke. From 5 to 6 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, guests can order from a prix-fixe menu (actually, $10.01) that includes choices among three appetizers (soup, salad or polenta), four entrees (salmon, chicken, steak or pasta) and three desserts (apple strudel, chocolate mousse or Key lime pie). The menu never changes, but that's fine by me: I could eat the polenta with three-cheese sauce followed by the grilled skirt steak every night of the week. And apparently some do. ''Some people come in two or three times a week, then tell me they'd like to try something different,'' said Joyce Flinn, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Eugene. ''I just laugh and think, 'That's what the regular menu is for.' '' The atmosphere at Amanda's is intimate, with two fireplaces and with windows overlooking a well-tended garden. It's the perfect spot for a special occasion, which is to say, the last place you'd expect to find such a bargain. So why do it? ''This is the way we advertise,'' Ms. Flinn said. ''It costs us $10 for the cloth napkins and the basket of bread, but it gets people in the restaurant.''

Over time the Windows operating system handles a lot of information, but much of it is temporary. Old settings, data and other outdated system information that Windows has but no longer needs can gum up the works and slow things down. Bits of software used by the operating system can also become damaged or corrupted over time and by crashes, which can contribute to slowness.

Fisher found this ''a smart and broad introduction to the political crisis in Africa.''    P.S., by Helen Schulman. (Bloomsbury, $13.95.) Louise Harrington is a divorced 38-year-old woman who gleefully stumbles into a fairy tale when she is reunited with a high-school boyfriend who has died in an accident and been reincarnated as a dashing 24-year-old dreamboat. Last year our reviewer, Bliss Broyard, called this a ''fresh and funny love story'' about a lonely woman who discovers a new version of herself.    THE BOTANY OF DESIRE: A Plant's-Eye View of the World, by Michael Pollan. (Random House, $13.95.) Linking four basic human desires (sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control) with plants that satisfy them (apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes), the author explores how plant species have thrived over the millenniums by seducing other creatures, including humans. ''Pollan really loves plants,'' Burkhard Bilger said here last year, and ''his prose both shimmers and snaps.'' Two other books reissued in time for gardening season include The Rose's Kiss: A Natural History of Flowers, by Peter Bernhardt (University of Chicago, $16), which in 1999 our reviewer, Verlyn Klinkenborg, called ''an engaging botanical overview of flowers,'' and Anatomy of a Rose: Exploring the Secret Life of Flowers, by Sharman Apt Russell (Perseus, $13). Last year one critic said this ''luminous blend of memoir, botany lesson and history of science'' is ''like a guided walking tour in a field of wildflowers.''    A PERFECT ARRANGEMENT, by Suzanne Berne. (Plume, $13.) In this disturbing tale about the lies, distortions and secrets of a contemporary family, a well-off working couple yield their children to a ''perfect'' nanny who is equally skilled at telling people what they want to hear and at seeing what she wants to see. The result is a ''penetrating, beautifully written novel,'' Elizabeth Graver wrote in these pages in 2001.    THE COLLECTED STORIES OF RICHARD YATES. (Picador USA, $16.) Whether they concern suburban housewives, young soldiers on the prowl in Paris, advertising executives or aspiring Hollywood screenwriters, these tales by the author of ''Revolutionary Road'' focus unflinchingly on lives gone sour and human weakness -- mainly self-deception and the dimly understood yearning for more luck, time and opportunity. Last year in the Book Review, Anthony Quinn called this a ''superb collection'' by ''a laureate of romantic loneliness.''    THE SHAPE OF SNAKES, by Minette Walters. (Jove, $7.99.) Haunted by the violent death of a black woman with Tourette's syndrome 20 years earlier, an English schoolteacher recreates the harrowing event with the help of newspaper clippings, police reports and personal letters, and forces her racist neighbors to confront their role in the murder. In 2001 our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, praised the novelist's ''commanding control over her inflammatory material -- and her readers.''    MARTHA PEAKE: A Novel of the American Revolution, by Patrick McGrath. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) This unsettling novel, which unfolds on strikingly different narrative levels, tells of a young man who is summoned by his dying uncle in 19th-century England to hear the story of a hideously deformed smuggler, poet and tormented soul whose daughter emigrated to America and became a martyr of the Revolution. In 2000 our reviewer, Barry Unsworth, found the book uneven but admired its ''rare qualities of power and urgency.''

Mount Mansfield, the state's highest peak, looms over the 230-year-old town, while the West Branch River slices through it, passing an inn, a general store and the quintessential Vermont white-steepled church. The heart of town is the intersection of Route 100, which runs along the spine of the Green Mountains, and Route 108, also known as Mountain Road, which closes in winter just beyond the Stowe Mountain Resort. Many of the village's lodgings, retail shops, restaurants and watering holes are clustered along the eight-mile stretch of Mountain Road between the village and the ski area, called simply ''the hill'' by locals. Stowe's population (just over 4,000 in 2000) has grown only tenfold in 200 years, but the seasonal influx of second-home owners and visitors increases the number of vehicles in town disproportionately. The traffic along Mountain Road can get nasty, especially during the height of winter, so time your outings wisely. If your visit coincides with the Stowe Winter Carnival (Jan. 17 to 26), be sure to take part in one of the many zany events around town, like moonlight turkey bowling on the frozen pond behind the Commodores Inn (www.stowewintercarnival).

''He's working a challenging, fascinating angle in his best stories -- assessing and enacting the ways that language can by turns overcome and be overcome by loss.''    BODY TOXIC: An Environmental Memoir, by Susanne Antonetta. (Counterpoint, $15.) A poet tells of growing up in southern New Jersey in a landscape blighted by toxic substances and radioactive waste, and of the profound effect her exposure to these poisons had on her health as an adult. For her, chemistry more than childhood trauma shaped her sense of self. ''Antonetta's considerable achievement . . . is to devise a literary voice for people who live in such places,'' Michael Pollan said here in 2001.    SIMPLE STORIES, by Ingo Schulze. (Vintage International, $13.) This German author's first novel is a baroquely expansive pastiche that employs 12 narrators from three generations to describe how a bunch of stodgy, provincial East Germans are forced to reinvent themselves after the fall of the Berlin Wall. ''It's a brilliant narrative strategy for capturing a time of giddy terror and -- much more rarely -- exhilaration,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote here in 2000.    BEFORE THE STORM: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus, by Rick Perlstein. (Hill & Wang, $17.) A scholar traces the origins of today's conservative movement to the Goldwater years and the Republican Party's resounding defeat in the 1964 presidential election. The result is ''a detailed and dramatic narrative of the rise of the modern right'' that combines ''prodigious research with journalistic flair,'' William Kristol wrote here in 2001.    THE END OF DAYS: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount, by Gershom Gorenberg. (Oxford University, $15.95.) A senior editor and columnist for The Jerusalem Post examines the incendiary mix of religious groups -- Arab, Jewish and fundamentalist Christians -- that view the destiny of the sacred Temple Mount as crucial to their apocalyptic faith. In his interviews with a broad spectrum of true believers, the author ''shows himself an insightful listener,'' John Dorfman said here last year.    ULTIMATE JOURNEY: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein. (Vintage Departures, $14.) The author, a book critic for The New York Times, follows the footsteps of Hsuan Tsang, a seventh-century Chinese monk whose odyssey spanned 10,000 miles and 17 years. Last year our reviewer, Alexander Frater, called this an ''intricate, closely argued and beautifully observed'' traveler's tale ''by a man . . . driven as much by the quiet despair of middle age as by a search for deeper meaning.''    COMFORT ME WITH APPLES: More Adventures at the Table, by Ruth Reichl. (Random House, $13.95.) In the sequel to her 1998 memoir, ''Tender at the Bone,'' the author picks up her story with her entry into the restaurant-critic business (now editor in chief of Gourmet, she is also a former critic for The Times), and in recounting her culinary and personal experiences she is always keenly aware of the way life is shaped by work, money and, yes, eating. ''Reichl understands that food lies at the center of human sociality,'' Paul Mattick wrote here last year. ''At the heart of her book is love (however laced with conflict) for her friends and family, and her wish to extend their number by having a child.''    DEATH OF A RIVER GUIDE, by Richard Flanagan. (Grove, $13.) As the narrator of this first novel slowly drowns after rescuing a tourist during a raft trip in the Tasmanian wild, his thoughts swirl around his own sad, unhappy life, his family's ancestral secrets and the lurid, striking history of Tasmania itself. The result is a ''haunting and ambitious'' tale, Jennifer Reese said here in 2001.    AFFINITY, by Sarah Waters. (Riverhead, $14.) The alternating journal entries of an upper-class Victorian lady doing charity work at an English prison and a female spiritualist convicted of fraud and assault reveals a growing -- and seemingly magical -- connection between the women. In 2000 our reviewer, Nancy Willard, called this novel ''a wrenching love story.''

It may seem like an odd subject for this radically original fiction writer to pursue, but in full obsessive-compulsive froth he issues a jeremiad against the nation's libraries (including the Library of Congress), which are jettisoning books and newspapers and replacing them with microfilm copies. His plea for preservation ''got me, as he intended, hopping mad,'' David Gates wrote here last year. ''If there's justice in the world, he'll rattle some cages.''    THREE APPLES FELL FROM HEAVEN, by Micheline Aharonian Marcom. (Riverhead, $14.) This darkly vivid first novel depicts the suffering of Christian Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Empire during World War I, but includes moments of tenderness, courage and unexpected generosity. ''The fierce beauty'' of the prose ''confronts readers with many breathtaking cruelties and carries us past them,'' Margot Livesey wrote here in 2001.    DRAGON HUNTER: Roy Chapman Andrews and the Central Asiatic Expeditions, by Charles Gallenkamp. (Penguin, $15.) Andrews was a world-famous explorer-zoologist, a real-life Indiana Jones whose hair-raising adventures culminated in five expeditions into Mongolia between 1922 and 1930 and the discovery of an amazing trove of dinosaur remains. Last year our reviewer, Barry Gewen, called this an ''enormously entertaining'' biography.    THE HOUSE IN PARIS, by Elizabeth Bowen. (Anchor, $13.) This 1936 novel takes place at a prim boardinghouse in Paris, where a doomed love affair has tragic consequences that resurface years later with the arrival of a mysterious young boy who has come to meet a mother he has never seen. Our reviewer, Edith H. Walton, admired the ''magic nicety'' of Bowen's style and said the tale ''is so perfect of its kind, so witty and so subtly exciting, that even those with robuster tastes can hardly deny its excellence.''    THE MORNING AFTER . . . and Long After: Selected Essays and Reviews, by Wilfrid Sheed. (Akadine, $19.95.) This 1971 collection of literary criticism and other nonfiction has been updated with a new introduction, a recent review and a 1999 essay about Sheed's experiences on the editorial board of the Book-of-the-Month Club. The book is ''dazzling, hilarious, astringent, serious without pomposity,'' Thomas R. Edwards wrote in these pages. The same publisher has restored to print Sheed's novel Max Jamison ($18.95), which explores the plight of a successful but burned-out theater critic groaning under the weight of his personal and professional obligations. In 1970 our reviewer, Richard Rhodes, found this book ''as interesting as . . . a clinical case study.'' Akadine has also reissued In Love With Daylight: A Memoir of Recovery ($16.95), Sheed's grim but buoyantly told 1995 account of his battles with alcohol, prescription drugs and metastatic cancer of the tongue.    POEMS: 1968-1998, by Paul Muldoon. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $19.) This collection features 30 years of protean verse by the dazzling and elusive Northern Irish poet (at right). Last year our reviewer, Richard Eder, admired Muldoon's ''whiplash of association and disassociation'' while noting that he ''has written poems of poignant directness as well.'' The same publisher has reissued ElectRic Light, by Seamus Heaney ($13), like Muldoon a Roman Catholic from Northern Ireland, whose latest book is a rich compendium of genres, from elegy to ecstatic lyric. It is the mature work of a master poet aware both of his aging and of his cultural authority and the responsibilities that go with it. The collection reflects ''Heaney's will (and ability) to speak of many kinds of experience to many kinds of reader,'' Langdon Hammer wrote in the Book Review in 2001.    KOSOVO CROSSING: The Reality of American Intervention in the Balkans, by David Fromkin. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.) The author examines Kosovo as a ''prism'' through which to study the extent to which America is willing and able to do good in the world. Fromkin ''brings to his subject both learning and a delightful prose style,'' Michael Elliott said here in 1999. Stay the Hand of Vengeance: The Politics of War Crimes Tribunals, by Gary Jonathan Bass (Princeton University, $19.95), is an exhaustive survey of how political leaders have dealt with the problem of war criminals since 1815 -- it's a mixed record, at best. Bass ''argues convincingly that trying war criminals is a better option than its alternative: vengeance,'' Chuck Sudetic wrote here in 2000.

Opera    ''AGRIPPINA.'' John Conklin (sets) and Jess Goldstein (costumes) have blended elements of many different Romes, from the Rome of the Caesars to the Rome of Cinecitt&#224;, in New York City Opera's colorful production of Handel's early, Italian opera. And the director, Lillian Groag, has helped bring to life the action in this unusually (for Handel) active work. The general level of singing could be better, but Brenda Harris is strong and compelling in the title role, and David Walker makes an appealing Ottone, the one decent character in this opera's web of deceit. And the conductor, Jane Glover, moves the music along, even if she doesn't bring to it the full dramatic definition that's evident in the action onstage. Nonetheless, the piece flies by in this production and finishes, thanks to some funny business with the supertitles, in a burst of genuine belly-laughter from the audience.

His first sketch, &quot;A Dinner at Poplar Walk,&quot; was published in the Monthly Magazine in December 1833. Dickens, born on February 7, 1812, was only twenty-one, but because of his work as a parliamentary reporter (he had taught himself shorthand and was able to take down speeches word for word), he was already familiar with seeing his name in print. Nevertheless, he related later that &quot;I walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half an hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there.&quot; Further sketches published in monthly and weekly magazines over the following months attracted considerable notice, and when Sketches by Boz appeared in volume form in February and December 1836, they were well reviewed. What everyone, including Dickens himself, considered especially remarkable was their breadth of scope, and in particular the variety of lower-class characters and scenes depicted, perhaps a first in English literature. One reviewer called them &quot;a perfect picture of the morals, manners, and habits of a great portion of English Society.&quot; ", "abstract": "\"He was so popular and so dominant a figure as both author and editor that the others would have to create their literary sensibilities more or less in reference to his.\"", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "'Charles Dickens'", "kicker": "First Chapter", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "'Charles Dickens'", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Smiley, Jane", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2002-06-30T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Books", "section_name": "Books", "byline": {"original": "By Jane Smiley", "person": [{"firstname": "Jane", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Smiley", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Transcript", "_id": "nyt://article/c14b67c7-9855-5756-80ad-8d1b44027b2a", "word_count": 4616, "uri": "nyt://article/c14b67c7-9855-5756-80ad-8d1b44027b2a"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/nyregion/nation-challenged-portraits-grief-victims-mystery-computers-bicycle-for-two.html", "snippet": "Brief biographical sketches of some of victims of World Trade Center attack; photos (L)", "lead_paragraph": "Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.", "abstract": "Brief biographical sketches of some of victims of World Trade Center attack; photos (L)", "print_page": "14", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Mystery of Computers, a Bicycle for Two, and the Tango Lesson", "kicker": "A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "A NATION CHALLENGED: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS; The Mystery of Computers, a Bicycle for Two, and the Tango Lesson", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "New York City", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "World Trade Center (NYC)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Biographical Information", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Hijacking", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Terrorism", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2002-02-24T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "section_name": "New York", "byline": {"original": "These sketches were written by Tara Bahrampour, Michael Brick, Constance L.
