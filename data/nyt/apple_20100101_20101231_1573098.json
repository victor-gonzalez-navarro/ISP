It would restrain 15 named individuals from a variety of activities, including weapons possession, trespassing and witness intimidation. It would also keep suspected gang members from associating with one another in a 100-block swath of the city and impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. In other Bay Area cities, like Fairfield, civil liberties groups have attacked such injunctions as violations of constitutional rights. In Oakland, opponents argue that an injunction would do little to curb crime and much to prompt racial profiling. A report in The Bay Citizen said that a series of at least four killings put law enforcement\u2019s focus on the north Oakland group. [The Oakland Tribune, The New York Times, The Bay Citizen]Proposition Billed as Antidote to Polarization | Proposition 14, backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is gaining traction. The initiative would replace traditional primaries in state and Congressional elections with twofold elections. All candidates would run in the first round. The top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, or lack thereof, would face each other in the general election. Voters\u2019 ultimate choice could be two Republicans or two Democrats, but it is likely that they would be the best-known or the wealthiest of the original field. Supporters say the measure would empower moderates and increase turnout. The state\u2019s $19 billion deficit, high unemployment and low morale may help the measure\u2019s chances; polls show a majority of voters favor it.

As a nod to Good Friday, with apologies to anyone who\u2019s off leavened items this week, here\u2019s a guide to the Big Apple\u2019s best buns: sticky, cinnamon, hot cross and otherwise:STICKY BUNSLet\u2019s start at the very beginning with a small bakery on Madison Avenue at 83rd Street, William Greenberg Jr. Desserts. When I was a child, my father went here for schnecken. The German word for snail, its reference is the spiral shape of the thing. In fact, while I identify schnecken with this particular rich-doughed, cinnamon-filled, raisin-laden, pecan-topped, caramelized breakfast staple, the label is as generic as \u201cdanish,\u201d and can be used to describe any flattened, coiled, cinnamon-raisin pastry. Sadly, William Jr. sold his bakery a number of years ago and the goods don\u2019t taste the same. If you want to experience a sticky bun as I knew it, you can go two blocks down to E.A.T., where Eli Zabar has created something that rivals the Greenberg classic. Or else call Scarsdale, where William\u2019s son Seth continues to bake (and sell) his father\u2019s schnecken. Seth uses the same ingredients as his dad and has the original 1930s recipe cards to prove it. You can taste the sour cream and butter in the dough; the perfectly burnt brown sugar in the thick glaze.
