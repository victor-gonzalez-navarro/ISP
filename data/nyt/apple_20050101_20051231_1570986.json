Fiona Apple: 'Extraordinary Machine' (Epic). Take 2 of this long-awaited, prematurely leaked album is the keeper. On the finished album, a little bit of Jon Brion's surreal cabaret orchestration brackets the newer stripped-down, focused versions of the songs. Ms. Apple continues her obsessive self-examination and convoluted thoughts of betrayal and regret, but now adds something: enough distance for some wry perspective.    2. M.I.A.: 'Arular' (Interscope). The means are modest: singsong choruses that could be playground chants, sparse tracks made with sounds from cheap synthesizers and drum machines. But the ambitions of M.I.A., a refugee from the civil war in Sri Lanka who went to art school in London, are huge and largely fulfilled on ''Arular,'' her debut album. The raps glance at violence, displacement, lust and determination in tracks that are irresistibly, incessantly danceable.    3. Shakira: 'Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1' (Epic). This is pop 2005: catchy songs about love found and (even better) lost that casually toss together reggaet\u00f3n, bossa nova, Colombian cumbia, chanson and half a dozen varieties of rock, for starters. It all suits a voice that can be insouciant, sultry or desperately impassioned, and a songwriter whose globe-hopping comes naturally.    4. Sufjan Stevens: 'Illinois' (Asthmatic Kitty). Songs about significant events and characters in Illinois -- the second of the 50 states Mr. Stevens plans to write albums about -- are at once grandly orchestrated, homespun and emotionally resonant. With his large supporting cast, Mr. Stevens finds ways to take history personally.    5. The Frames: 'Burn the Maps' (Anti-). If Radiohead had a love life but stayed just as bleak, it would sound like the Frames on this album of heartsick, craggy, majestic rock songs that never trade drama for melodrama.    6. Bright Eyes: 'Digital Ash in a Digital Urn' (Saddle Creek). Conor Oberst, a k a Bright Eyes, released two albums simultaneously in 2005: the folk-rocking ''I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning'' and the far more electronic ''Digital Ash in a Digital Urn.'' Both are among the year's best albums. Yet where ''Wide Awake'' simply adds to Mr. Oberst's stockpile of brilliantly observed songs about personal matters like ambition and casual sex, ''Digital Ash'' uses its ricocheting, disembodied sounds to contemplate time, war, death and the meaning of life.    7. Bettye LaVette: 'I've Got My Own Hell to Raise' (Anti-). It seems all too conceptual to have a 59-year-old soul-music trouper sing a collection of songs by women. But Ms. LaVette's flinty voice and lean, bluesy, cannily arranged band tear into every song, turning old wounds into tokens of survival.    8. Stephen Malkmus: 'Face the Truth' (Matador). Three albums after the breakup of Pavement, his definitive 1990's indie-rock band, Stephen Malkmus remains waywardly alternative. His lyrics fling aper\u00e7us at life, art and commerce, while his tunes melt down the old verse-chorus-verse, deploy banjos and wobbly synthesizers, amble off on jam-band tangents, plunge into garage-rock or do the acoustic tango. He's as smart as he is mercurial.    9. Konono No. 1: 'Congotronics' (Crammed Discs). Take traditional, polyrhythmic thumb-piano trance music from Congo, plinking away in dizzying syncopated patterns. To crank it up for big outdoor parties, run it through buzzy pickups and amplifiers made from, among other things, scavenged car parts. The result is electric Minimalism that's exuberant and relentless, changing from percolating to hypnotic to a tingle that reaches deep into the nervous system.    10. Sleater-Kinney: 'The Woods' (Sub Pop). Distortion is everywhere on ''The Woods,'' Sleater-Kinney's seventh album, and it brings a nervy intensity to songs already worked up. With just two guitars, drums and Corin Tucker's banshee wail, Sleater-Kinney can sound as immense as a metal band and as bristling and unkempt as their indie-rock beginnings. Singing about love and war, truth and spectacle, the trio still plays as if everything were at stake.

Its producer, Jon Brion, has said that Ms. Apple's label, Sony Music's Epic Records, shelved the album because it didn't hear potential hit singles. An Epic spokeswoman said, ''Fiona has not yet delivered her next album.'' Lately, what purports to be the full album, 11 songs, has been leaked onto the Internet, where -- despite the efforts of Sony's legal department -- a simple search will find multiple sources of downloads. The album is an oddball gem.    Its producer, Mr. Brion, is fond of instruments that huff and plink and wheeze, as he showed in his soundtrack for ''I [heart] Huckabees.'' Epic may have been discomfited that Ms. Apple's collaboration with him doesn't sound anything like what's on the radio now. As a songwriter, she's the same Fiona Apple who sold millions of copies of her first two albums; she's still sultry and sullen, obsessing in detail over why her romances went wrong and teetering between regret and revenge. Her vocals smolder like torch songs, then boil over with rage and accusations. But this time, the music doesn't always mope with her.    The album sets the 21st century aside. The beats are often waltzes and oom-pahs, not hip-hop or punk; the arrangements are full of cellos, horns, bells and vintage keyboards. Ms. Apple's piano and voice are still at the center of the music, but now orchestras and show bands sprout around her, adding layers of whimsy and artifice. Ms. Apple has always placed herself somewhere between confession and entertainment, but in songs like ''Window'' or ''Better Version of Me,'' the carnival bounces and mock-Hollywood glitz put a cartoonish frame around her traumas, giving them a brand-new perspective.    Had it been released, ''Extraordinary Machine'' would have been a fine counterbalance to a pop moment full of monolithic, self-righteous sincerity. As it stands, mysteriously leaked and proliferating, the album is an object lesson in how an Internet that's not controlled by copyright holders can set artistic expression free.

I want to buy a new iMac now, but was wondering if I should wait until the new Intel-based versions appear. Is there any reason to wait?    A. Apple Computer's recent announcement that it was changing the processors inside its Macintosh computers means some big changes when the company switches to Intel-based chips from the current PowerPC processors made by I.B.M. and Motorola. Apple plans to release some Macs with Intel processors starting in 2006, and hopes to have most new Macs running the chips by 2007.

Is it best to leave it plugged into a power source at home, or to leave it unplugged so it can discharge and then recharge it as necessary?    A. Apple Computer does not recommend leaving the PowerBook plugged in all the time with its lithium-ion battery connected because the internal chemistry can stagnate, which may shorten battery life. Unplugging the laptop and working from the battery once a month or so helps to discharge the stored energy and gets those electrons moving.    The company also recommends that you calibrate your laptop's battery every few months. Laptop batteries contain microprocessors that tell the computer how much of a charge is left, but they can get out of sync. This causes the computer to give incorrect information about the charge status. Calibration helps the battery and computer communicate more accurately.

[Page C1.]    Japanese Economy Growing After a Decade of Problems  After more than a decade of working off excessive debt, bloated payrolls and overbuilt factory capacity, Japan seems to have addressed its problems and emerged leaner and more competitive, economists say. Japan's economy is projected to be growing at a faster rate than Europe's this year. [C1.]    Gap, the Troubled Retailer, Faces Mounting Problems  Gap, the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, has largely written off the holiday selling season, cutting its forecast for full year earnings after finding that the number of shoppers walking into its stores has fallen by 8 percent. Sales are slumping across all three divisions, a string of executives have left in recent months and Wall Street analysts are openly questioning whether the company's leadership is up to the job. [C1.]    General Motors Selects a New Chief Financial Officer  General Motors, which is battling to reverse losses in North America and energize its sagging market share, replaced its chief financial officer with a longtime company executive who has experience in cost-cutting.

[C5.]    Group Plans Lawsuit to Restrict Soda Sales in High Schools  The Center for Science in the Public Interest, arguing that soda and other sugary beverages are harmful to students' health and that selling those drinks in schools sends a message that their regular consumption is perfectly fine, plans to file a lawsuit seeking to ban sales of the beverage in high schools.

Members No More, but Happy as Shareholders  Many of the 1,366 seat holders of the New York Stock Exchange will introduce themselves by saying, ''I have been a member since'' That oft-repeated phrase was put to rest when the members overwhelmingly voted to approve the exchange's merger with Archipelago Holdings, an all-electronic exchange. The deal will transform the 213-year old New York exchange, previously a not-for-profit entity, into a publicly traded company. [C3.]    A Time Warner Director Gives Up Board Seat at Lazard  Robert C. Clark, who was a director of Time Warner and of Lazard, the investment bank advising Carl C.

[C5.]    Mel Gibson Developing a TV Mini-Series on the Holocaust  Mel Gibson, whose ''The Passion of the Christ'' was criticized by some as anti-Semitic, is developing a nonfiction miniseries about the Holocaust. Mr. Gibson's television production company will base the four-hour miniseries for ABC on the self-published memoir of Flory A. Van Beek, a Dutch Jew whose gentile neighbors hid her from the Nazis but who lost several relatives in concentration camps. [C1.]    NBC Universal to Sell TV Shows at iTunes Music Store  NBC Universal said it would start to sell downloadable versions of 11 of its current and older television shows through Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store. NBC is the second major television network to distribute programming through Apple. In October, Apple started to sell episodes from five programs on the ABC network. Those programs can be watched both on Apple's latest generation of iPod portable players and on Apple and Windows-based personal computers running Apple's iTunes software.

[C3.]    An increase in productivity lifted stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.85, to 10,856.86; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.61, percent, to 1,263.70; and the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.12, to 2,260.76.

The new service builds on the company's TiVo to Go feature, which allows some subscribers to transfer shows to a laptop or personal computer.    Behind the News -- The television networks have yet another reason to hate TiVo, which first encroached on their turf by offering viewers the ability to watch television shows when they wanted, without the commercials.      Now, TiVo could hurt the networks' attempts to develop another revenue stream by selling shows by the episode. For instance, ABC plans to sell downloads of ''Desperate Housewives'' on Apple iPods for 99 cents. But why pay, when you can download from TiVo for free?    X-GAMES BEGIN    The News -- Microsoft released its Xbox 360, its next-generation game machine, at midnight on Tuesday. Buyers lined up for hours to be among the first to purchase it.    Behind the News -- Industry analysts said the early buzz around the Xbox 360 might not mean much in the long run. The real question is whether the 360 can outsell Sony's next-generation game console, PlayStation 3, which is not due out until spring.    LIBRARY DOWNLOAD    The News -- Google gave $3 million to help the Library of Congress build a World Digital Library on the Web. For the project, the National Library of Egypt has already agreed to digitize documents of Islamic science from the 10th century.    Behind the News -- Google's gift may be good public relations. The Library of Congress emphasized that Google's gift comes with no strings attached and no copyright problems. That would be welcome news for Google, which has faced copyright issues because of its Book Search project, a book- scanning effort in partnership with five research libraries.    GOODNIGHT, TED    The News -- On Tuesday, Ted Koppel, the anchor of ''Nightline'' ended his 25-year reign as late night's Mr. Serious.    Behind the News -- Will ''Nightline'' survive? Under Mr. Koppel, it has struggled in the ratings, generally falling behind NBC's ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' and CBS's ''Late Show With David Letterman.'' Now, three anchors will replace Mr. Koppel, and it's unknown how quickly ABC expects ratings success.", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "New Media In, Old-Media Star Out | Nov. 20-26", "kicker": "THE WEEK", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THE WEEK; New Media In, Old-Media Star Out | Nov. 20-26", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2005-11-27T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Week in Review Desk", "section_name": "Week in Review", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/81837d94-9f73-53a3-be18-37d09b6386ec", "word_count": 414, "uri": "nyt://article/81837d94-9f73-53a3-be18-37d09b6386ec"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/technology/circuits/an-ipod-worth-keeping-an-eye-on.html", "snippet": "The latest iPod model, unveiled last week, is deliciously thin, and in addition to its usual repertoire, it can now play video.", "lead_paragraph": "Why does this page look this way?", "abstract": "The latest iPod model, unveiled last week, is deliciously thin, and in addition to its usual repertoire, it can now play video.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "An iPod Worth Keeping an Eye On", "kicker": "David Pogue", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "An iPod Worth Keeping an Eye On", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2005-10-18T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Technology / Circuits", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By David Pogue", "person": [{"firstname": "David", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Pogue", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Sidebar", "_id": "nyt://article/15aeb7ed-4b9a-5225-abd2-045999da7e5d", "word_count": 891, "uri": "nyt://article/15aeb7ed-4b9a-5225-abd2-045999da7e5d"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/pageoneplus/corrections-849251.html", "snippet": "A graphic on this page last Sunday about the week's developments in media misstated two facts about the Apple iPod.

Nine days after Apple introduced the video iPod, the distributor Central Park Media announced plans to provide anime -- including the adventures of Chirico Cuvie in the series ''Armored Trooper Votoms.'' Visitors to the company's Web site (www.centralparkmedia.com/ipod/) can download ''Votoms,'' a Japanese adventure series, and trailers for other anime shows.

(AP)    Pension Agency Objects to Airline's Reorganization Plan  The government agency that insures corporate pensions has objected to United Airlines' reorganization plan, saying in court documents that the carrier has changed a deal covering the termination of its pensions. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said in a filing that the airline's disclosure statement, which details its financial model, is ''unconfirmable.'' United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, must get bankruptcy court approval of the statement before asking creditors to vote on restructuring. The agency complained that the plan was inconsistent with a settlement the parties reached last spring for the airline to turn its pensions over to the government.   (Reuters)    Medical Device Maker Posts a Quarterly Loss  Boston Scientific said yesterday that it had lost ground to its only medical device rival in the lucrative market for drug-coated heart stents, reporting a $269 million third-quarter loss and slowing sales of a stent that provided big profits last year. The performance, hurt by a $598 million expense for a legal settlement, fell short of company's projection and Wall Street's expectations. Boston Scientific executives said in a conference call with analysts that its Taxus stent has lost market share to the Cypher stent made by Johnson & Johnson's Cordis Corporation. The company, based in Natick, Mass., said it lost 33 cents a share and the results compared with a profit of $258 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent, to $1.51 billion.   (AP)    Bank of America's Purchase of MBNA Advances  Delaware's banking commissioner yesterday approved the proposed $35 billion acquisition of MBNA by the Bank of America Corporation, moving the buyout of the world's largest independent credit card issuer one step closer to completion. The approval of the Delaware banking commissioner, Robert Glen, was required because MBNA is based in Wilmington, Del. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, N.C.   (AP)    Justice Department Approves Software Merger  Adobe Systems said late Thursday that the Justice Department had approved its $3.4 billion acquisition of Macromedia. Adobe and Macromedia, two of the largest providers of graphic design software, must wait for several European jurisdictions to approve the deal before it can close. Adobe's Illustrator and Macromedia's Freehand are two of the leading products for vector graphics illustration, a term for drawings that are stored as collections of points and objects instead of pixels. A combined company would also own a substantial part of the market for Web site-building tools.   (AP)    Profit Rises 21 Percent at Insurer UnitedHealth  The UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurance companies, reported a 21 percent increase in third-quarter profit on membership gains and lower-than-expected medical costs. The company forecast profit growth would continue through 2006 at an annual rate of at least 15 percent. UnitedHealth predicted a Medicare prescription drug benefit would add 2 million to 3 million members to its rolls next year, potentially increasing 2006 earnings by 5 cents a share. UnitedHealth said it expected to complete its acquisition of PacifiCare Health by year-end or early in 2006. UnitedHealth said its third-quarter profit rose to $842 million, or 64 cents a share, from $698 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $11.3 billion.   (Reuters)    Bush Seeks End to Lumber Trade Dispute With Canada  President Bush told the Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin yesterday that it was time to find a solution to a long-running trade fight between the two countries over softwood lumber. A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Martin spoke by telephone for about 20 minutes, and trade was a major part of their discussion. Mr. Martin criticized the United States government last week for its position on trade in lumber, saying Washington was ignoring a North American Free Trade Agreement ruling against United States duties on Canadian softwood lumber.   (Reuters)    Developer's Bid for British Grocer Is Accepted  A billionaire property developer, Robert Tchenguiz, and two partners won the right to buy Somerfield, a British grocer, for \u00a31.08 billion ($1.9 billion) to gain control of its real estate. The bid, 197 pence for each share in Somerfield, was accepted, Anthony Cardew, a spokesman for Somerfield, said yesterday. The investor group includes Tchenguiz, Apax Partners Worldwide and Barclays Capital. Mr. Tchenguiz will get control of 1,300 Somerfield and Kwik Save stores. Somerfield is based in Bristol, England.

Jobs, the company's co-founder and chief executive, was back last week to introduce an iPod that can play video.     Behind the News -- The bells and whistles of an Apple product unveiling are never to be ignored, but this time it was wedding bells: iPod and television are the happy couple. The new device can shop online for episodes from some ABC and Disney Channel shows, including from the night before, for about $2 a pop. The move comes after two years of Mr. Jobs's saying that nobody would watch a movie on a two-inch screen.    TO BOSTON WE GO    The News -- JetBlue said Tuesday that next month it would introduce 10 daily flights between New York and Boston.    Behind the News -- It's the kind of airfare that could almost make a Yankee fan want to go into enemy territory: $25 one way, for tickets bought by this Thursday. Thereafter the flight will cost $40 to $120. But the route has long been dominated by the traditional major carriers, and they were not without an answer for JetBlue's latest nudging onto their turf. The next day American Airlines began offering $25 tickets on the same route, and Delta introduced a $40 fare. Take that, rookie.    THE FOOT-WIDE JOURNAL    The News -- The Wall Street Journal plans to shrink by about the width of the 'Street' in its banner.    Behind the News -- The measure comes on the heels of The Journal's plan to shrink its international edition to tabloid size, starting next month. Both moves are in part a response to the increase in the cost of newsprint, an industrywide concern that has led other papers to similar decisions. Making The Journal smaller is expected to save its owner, Dow Jones, about $18 million a year. The company has said that it expected the smaller size to be more appealing to readers.    ANOTHER GOOD THING?    The News -- Martha Stewart is taking on a new partner, the housing developer KB Homes. The deal calls for a subdivision in Cary, N.C., to incorporate the style of Ms. Stewart's own homes into its 650 houses.    Behind the News -- Before anyone who wants to live like Martha packs up the free-range chickens and heads to Cary, there are one or two questions to consider: one, is the housing industry heading into a downturn, and two, is Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose stock has fallen since March, diluting its brand as it branches into areas like satellite radio and music producing?    YOU'VE GOT AOL!    The News -- AOL.com has positioned itself as a free Web portal in recent months, with much of the content that used to be available only to subscribers now open to everyone. Last week, Time Warner, AOL's parent, officially unveiled the advertising campaign for it (at a cost estimated at $50 million).    Behind the News -- The paying user continues to flee AOL, but Web sites that are part of it -- Moviefone, Mapquest, Netscape -- are a draw. That appeal may be behind talks between Time Warner and others regarding potential investments in AOL. Microsoft, Google, Comcast and Yahoo have been named as suitors or potential suitors.", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "New Routes | Oct. 9-15", "kicker": "THE WEEK", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THE WEEK; New Routes | Oct. 9-15", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2005-10-16T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Week in Review Desk", "section_name": "Week in Review", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/5d567e07-330d-5d34-8996-606948756ee8", "word_count": 580, "uri": "nyt://article/5d567e07-330d-5d34-8996-606948756ee8"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/technology/circuits/notebooks-come-in-at-under-a-thousandwith-speed-and.html", "snippet": "The first notebook computers to dip below $1,000 were slow, not very stylish and not widely embraced by consumers.

A Warning to 'Greedy' Record Companies       Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, vowed yesterday to resist the ''greedy'' demands of music companies for increases in the prices of downloads, The Associated Press reported. Speaking before the opening of the Apple Expo in Paris, he said some record companies were campaigning for higher prices on Apple's iTunes Music Store Web site (apple.com/itunes) and warned that higher prices would encourage piracy. Mr. Jobs said the companies, by eliminating manufacturing and marketing costs, make more profit by selling a song through iTunes than on CD. ''So if they want to raise the prices,'' he said, ''it just means they're getting a little greedy.''    Rapping and Rocking       Rap is knocking at the door of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

''We're big fans of hip-hop,'' he said, ''and what we do as a band is very progressive. So we thought, why don't we make hip-hop-style videos in the country world?'' Then they took the idea one step further: the video for ''Hillbillies,'' the first single from the group's self-titled album, is almost a shot-for-shot cover of the clip for Snoop Dogg's ''Drop It Like It's Hot,'' which was released last fall.    In crisp black and white with minimal decoration, the video for Snoop's song, directed by Paul Hunter, was as slyly experimental as its beat, a taut arrangement of bass, snare and mouth clacks. For ''Hillbillies,'' the director Philip Andelman shot Hot Apple Pie in the same fashion but swapped in country signifiers for Snoop's hip-hop product shots. A yacht became a bass boat, a Rolls-Royce Phantom gave way to a monster truck and a diamond-encrusted MP3 player was replaced by a Walkman bedecked in fake bling. (And black dancers were replaced by white ones.) Mr. Seals, the cousin of Jim Seals of the 70's schlock-poppers Seals & Crofts, said, ''We call it progressive hillbilly.''    The cover-video concept isn't completely new -- parody videos abound, and ''Space Lord,'' a 1998 video by the rock outfit Monster Magnet, viciously sent up the glammy aesthetic of Puff Daddy and Mase. Though Mr. Seals hasn't met Snoop -- ''I would love his stamp of approval,'' he said -- he has found acceptance elsewhere. With relatively little radio play, ''Hot Apple Pie'' sold more than 18,000 copies in its first week of release and made its debut at No. 6 on the Billboard country album chart, both the highest figures for a new country group in the SoundScan era.

But the best part may be, as it often is in real life, the post-Thanksgiving turkey sandwich in Philadelphia.    8 P.M. (Cinemax) OCEAN'S TWELVE -- (2004). The best parts of Steven Soderbergh's glamorous remake have nothing to do with the heist. It's a tie between Danny Ocean (George Clooney) fretting about whether he looks 50 and Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) being persuaded to impersonate a movie star: JuliaRoberts. Mr. Clooney is now 44, by the way.    9 P.M. (CBS) TWO AND A HALF MEN -- It had to happen. Charlie (Charlie Sheen) and his nephew, Jake (Angus T. Jones, above right, with Mr. Sheen), fall for the same woman. She's a ballet teacher, played by Emmanuelle Vaugier of the horror movie ''SawII.'' Jake may even come to love dance class.    9 P.M. (Biography) PRIDE AND PREJUDICE -- (1995). This is the BBC and A&E version, with Colin Firth as the rich and arrogant Mr.Darcy and Jennifer Ehle (near right, with Mr. Firth) as the spirited and ahead-of-her-time Elizabeth Bennet, who absolutely cannot tolerate him. Part 1 of 3.    10 P.M. (NBC) MEDIUM -- It's always a struggle between work and home, even for psychics. Allison DuBois (Patricia Arquette) doesn't know whether to worry more about the re-election campaign of her boss, District Attorney Devalos (Miguel Sandoval), or the old college girlfriend that her husband, Joe (Jake Weber), has just run into.    MIDNIGHT (TCM) THE WOMEN -- (1939). Norma Shearer is the decent Park Avenue wife whose husband is leaving her for a d\u00e9class\u00e9 sales clerk. Joan Crawford is the clerk. Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard have the best fight scene. George Cukor's interpretation of Clare Boothe Luce's play about wealthy women who have nothing better to do than gossip, play cards and divorce is still absolutely delicious.

THE inability to get large public projects off the ground in New York reflects less a lack of ambition than a failure to come to consensus over the role of government in land use.

Actually, they were created by real people with precious dollars, public and private (including some by another Moses, Robert). These are our temples.

You can use whatever ribs you like; meaty ones are best, but as long as the ribs are separated, rather than in a slab, they'll do just fine. As for the chicken, I implore you to use thighs, bone-in, skin-on because the meat is more tender and the taste infinitely better.

THE LAST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS: Being the Epic Tale of the Great Captain's Fourth Expedition, Including Accounts of Swordfight, Mutiny, Shipwreck, Gold, War, Hurricane, and Discovery. By Martin Dugard. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) Vast new lands, strange new peoples, Edenic flora and fauna aside, Columbus's four voyages to the new world were commercial enterprises, with a nervous Spanish court expecting a return on its investment. In a rich, fluent account, Dugard offers both a gripping naval adventure and a revealing history of the competitive mercantile politics of the turn of the 16th century, and portrays Columbus as a star-crossed striver eager to legitimize his quest. Reined in by hard-nosed administrators and for a time imprisoned for failing to maintain order in the critical outpost of Santo Domingo, the Admiral of the Ocean Sea made a final, desperate attempt in 1502 to find that elusive passage to India. Perhaps he knew it was doomed when, while searching for gold in the lush Panamanian jungle, a scout was told by angry inhabitants that ''these people were going to burn our ships and kill us all,'' a threat they nearly carried out. The leaking fleet escaped, only to be marooned in Jamaica for a year. But Columbus's ingenuity never failed him. In an archetypal high-seas scam, when the local tribe in Jamaica began to cut off the castaways' food supply, he consulted an astronomy text and told the Indians ''God would send them a clear token from heaven of the punishment they were about to receive'' if they didn't cough up the daily victuals; right on schedule a lunar eclipse came, the Indians cried for mercy, and that was that. Dugard's detailed reconstructions, while sometimes far-fetched (how could he know that Columbus's prison shackles were ''clattering lightly'' as he wrote an apology to Ferdinand and Isabella?), rely on ships' logs, journals, letters and other contemporary accounts, letting the participants describe these extraordinary adventures themselves.", "print_page": "14", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Nonfiction Chronicle", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "NONFICTION CHRONICLE", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Jobs, Steven P", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Dugard, Martin", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Parks, Tim", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Simon, William L", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Doonan, Simon", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2005-07-31T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "section_name": "Books", "byline": {"original": "By Ben Sisario", "person": [{"firstname": "Ben", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Sisario", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/9b5d5e1a-8b99-5486-bc54-4389d41a2b71", "word_count": 1471, "uri": "nyt://article/9b5d5e1a-8b99-5486-bc54-4389d41a2b71"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/10/business/stewart-briefly-becomes-focus-of-a-canadian-political-quarrel.html", "snippet": "Martha Stewart tells television viewers that she cannot attend charity event in Canada because of delay in issuance of special visa that Canadian government requires of convicted felons on probation; prodding from opposition party promptly brings ...", "lead_paragraph": "Martha Stewart discovered a new drawback in being an ex-convict last week when she thought that she would not be allowed to cross the border into Canada.

Q. What's it like for Palm watching this long-running legal drama involving R.I.M.?    A. The one thing that we can continue to be focused on is competing in the marketplace, and certainly this may bring some uncertainty to R.I.M.'s customers and they may be more interested in looking at some of our solutions. But I don't think -- my sense is that ultimately it will be resolved between the parties and I think the idea that the BlackBerry service will be discontinued is extremely unlikely.    Q. There is a perception out there that a recent court ruling, which refused to impose a settlement between R.I.M. and the patent holding company, NTP, is good news for you. Your stock went up on the news and a lot of people see this as an opportunity for Palm to grab even more market share of corporate customers.    A. If that's the perception among enterprise customers, then that's the one that matters. That those customers are saying, ''Gee, maybe I want to look at another solution here because I'm not sure of what's going to happen to R.I.M.'' -- then I think that could benefit us at some level.

Prison for Chipping Inca Ruins       A camera-crane operator has been sentenced to six years in prison five years after his equipment tipped and chipped a stone sundial while filming a beer company commercial at the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu in Peru, The Associated Press reported. A local court in Urubamba, about 340 miles southeast of Lima, the capital, said that the operator, Walter Leonidas Espinoza, had been found guilty on Nov. 3 of destruction and alteration of cultural goods. The charge carries a maximum penalty of eight years in prison. Antonia Terrazas, a lawyer speaking for the Institute of Culture, said offenders were rarely charged, and when prosecuted and found guilty, were normally sentenced only to a fine or a few months in jail. The authorities said Mr. Espinoza had appealed his sentence.    Footnotes       Norbert Leo Butz has extended his contract with the musical ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' through July.

[Page C1.]    A Fierce Scrum Takes Shape Among Chip Makers  Toshiba is anxious to guard the secrets at its semiconductor plants as it wages a battle for control of the fast-growing market for the advanced memory chips at the heart of portable music devices like the Apple iPod Nano. The fight pits Toshiba and its partner, SanDisk, against Samsung Electronics.

[C6.]    A Shift in Emphasis for Trade Meeting  Recognizing that little progress can be expected on intractable issues like farm subsidies, officials at global trade talks scheduled to begin in Hong Kong now appear likely to focus heavily on increasing exports from the world's poorest countries. Pascal Lamy, left, director general of the World Trade Organization, and others have called with increasing emphasis in the last few days for a detailed agreement eliminating all duties and quotas on the exports of at least 32 of the world's poor countries.

FIRE AND HONEY: ''Wild Ducks Flying Backward,'' a collection of very short writings and a few previously unpublished poems by the ever-zany Tom Robbins, lands at No. 15 on the nonfiction list this week. Robbins, whose novels include ''Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'' and ''Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas,'' muses here on everything from the actress Debra Winger (''She's walked a tightrope between fire and honey, between sulfur and roses, between sarcasm and succor, between monolith and disco ball'') to the letter ''Z'': ''In contrast to that prim, trim, self-absorbed supermodel, 'I,' or to 'O,' the voluptuous, orgasmic, bighearted slut, were 'Z' a woman, she would be a femme fatale, the consonant we love to fear and fear to love.'' The book also includes a hilarious essay about the Czech translation of his 1984 novel, ''Jitterbug Perfume,'' which he had parts of translated back into English. (''The red beet is a melancholy vegetable, always prepared to suffer. And from such turnip you cannot get any blood.'') And while he's at it, Robbins also explains the meaning of life: ''Our purpose is to consciously, deliberately evolve toward a wiser, more liberated and luminous state of being; to return to Eden, make friends with the snake and set up our computers among the wild apple trees. . . . Or, barring that, to turn out a good thin-crust pizza and a strong glass of beer.''

[C9.]    White House Projects a Decline in Budget Deficit  The White House predicted that the federal budget deficit will drop sharply this year and continue to shrink for the next four years. In a mid-year update on the budget, the administration said higher tax revenue would reduce this year's deficit to $333 billion, $79 billion less than in 2004 and $94 billion less than the administration had predicted in February.

[A20.]    The health care products maker Abbott Laboratories said that its second-quarter earnings rose 38 percent, helped by sales of diagnostic products and an arthritis drug. But Abbott repeated a forecast that its third-quarter results would fall short of expectations, and its shares fell 4 percent.

The management of the new IFC Center in Greenwich Village is hoping so. Not only has it installed a restaurant, the Waverly, with a menu overseen by the chef couple Claudia Fleming and Gerry Hayden; it's also gone the gourmet route at the concession stand, where the refreshments include truffle-butter-topped organic popcorn and Niman Ranch hot dogs.    ''Our focus is obviously a fresh product and not what you would get at a major cineplex,'' said Dean Martinus, president of Great Performances, the catering company that runs the stand. While it does offer the standard M&M's and Twizzlers, future menu items will include sliced apples with cheddar from Murray's, the revered cheese shop just around the corner.    But do patrons want to go gourmet during the summer popcorn season? In an unscientific survey on a recent Friday night, the buttered tub with soda outsold the fancy treats, a finding the company doesn't dispute. (One exception: Il Laboratorio del Gelato ice cream is deservedly popular, though it might be more so if it were served slightly less frozen. Just a thought.)    ''When people come to a movie, they don't necessarily want the exotic stuff,'' said Victor Lu, a veteran concession employee -- ''we're the unsung heroes of movie theaters'' -- and a film student at New York University. Speaking of theater owners, he added: ''This is their bread and butter. They have to make it accessible.'' Though Mr. Lu said customers had been shying away from the truffle butter (''If they knew how expensive truffles were,'' he theorized, ''they'd order it more''), at least one moviegoer was tempted. ''If      just seemed so decadent, how could we not try it?'' said Jason Brown, a 31-year-old graphic designer from Queens. The verdict? ''It would've been good on pasta.''    MELENA Z.

Ms. Presilla likes plates so much, she says, that when she decided to open a couple of restaurants in northern New Jersey, her husband was mostly just relieved that her bags and boxes and packages of plates would stop coming to the house.    But plates, for Ms. Presilla, aren't so much about the shape or the weight or the color or the earthiness or the lack of it. When she sees a plate, she visualizes the food she would serve on it. A plate, or a spoon, or even a shot glass is the canvas that either fades to neutral or works with the food to create a tableau that is crucial to the experience of every diner -- intensely flavored edible art that displays the food in its deconstructed glory. A friend's gift of 100 volcanic stones, for example, was inspiration for a dramatic adaptation of a Peruvian ceviche dish she now serves at her South American restaurant, Cucharamama, in Hoboken.

But the centerpiece is the fourth-floor terrace, designed by Bob Puccini, with its small workout room, pool and cocktail lounge, Jbar.

[Page A8.]    Aon Settles With Three States  Aon agreed to pay restitution of $190 million to its customers because top executives of the insurance broker directed transactions that helped mislead customers and possibly increased costs for them, the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said. The accusations were made in a complaint filed as the company reached settlements with Connecticut, Illinois and New York. [C3.]    F.D.A. Seizes Glaxo Tablets  The Food and Drug Administration, angered by quality-control problems it said had dragged on for two years, used marshals to seize millions of tablets of the antidepressant Paxil CR and Avandamet, a diabetes medicine, from GlaxoSmithKline plants. [A7.]    Cost of Medicare Raised Again  The Congressional Budget Office raised its estimate of Medicare spending and said the new drug benefit would cost more than it assumed when Congress passed it in 2003. [A14.]    Apple Suing Web Site Publishers  A California judge heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by Apple Computer to force three Web site publishers to reveal the names of sources who disclosed to them Apple's plans for future products. [C4.]    Four Investment Banks Settle  Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs and UBS, which helped sell WorldCom bonds to the public two years before the company collapsed, agreed to pay a little more than $100 million to settle with investors who lost money in the deals. [C4.]    Jurors in the government's case against Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, began deliberations to determine whether he orchestrated an $11 billion fraud that brought down the company in 2002. [C10.]    Management Shake-Up at Delphi  Alan S. Dawes, left, the chief financial officer of Delphi, resigned after the board expressed a ''loss of confidence.'' In addition, Delphi's chief accountant, Paul Free, resigned, and the board demoted the vice president of treasury, John Blahnik, who was also removed as a corporate officer. The management shake-up comes after the company admitted that it had inflated income statements. The scope of the accounting irregularities at Delphi, which are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, appears to be wider than the company initially said. [C3.]    Germany Wins G.M. Car Contract  General Motors has decided to build midsize Opels and Saabs in Germany rather than in Sweden because it will cost $262 million less at a time when G.M. is trying to wring $655 million in cost savings a year out of its money-losing European operations. [C3.]    Boeing Suspension Ends  The Air Force ended a 20-month suspension on doing business with the rocket units of Boeing that began when Boeing was found to have improperly obtained proprietary documents and trade secrets from Lockheed Martin. [C2.]    ChoicePoint Faces Several Inquiries  ChoicePoint, the commercial data broker that inadvertently sold tens of thousands of consumer records to thieves masquerading as small business clients, announced that it was the subject of consumer lawsuits, a barrage of inquiries from state attorneys general, and two federal investigations.

But is that really the most accurate description? Some of the new season's books would suggest a more universal truism: travel is never easy.    The Spanish grow olives, ''but the taste is so bitter, I am sure you would not like it.'' In China, ''it is a common thing to stumble over the bodies of dead babies in the streets.'' The Irish, ''if affronted, are filled with rage.'' These withering pronouncements come from a Victorian writer named Mrs. Favell Lee Mortimer, perhaps the most uncharitable person ever to have emerged from the country that also brought us Simon Cowell and Jack the Ripper. In THE CLUMSIEST PEOPLE IN EUROPE: Or, Mrs. Mortimer's Bad-Tempered Guide to the Victorian World (Bloomsbury, $19.95), the present-day writer and editor Todd Pruzan collects entries from three volumes of Mrs. Mortimer's wonderfully odious, travel-based misanthropy. Pruzan also provides some telling biographical details about Mortimer -- most notably that she left England only twice. Moreover, despite being a successful children's author whose Bible primer aimed at 4-year-olds sold a million copies, Mortimer led a life of utter misery. Her first great romantic attachment (to Henry Manning, who became Cardinal Manning) was unrequited; she later married a violent, cruel man from whom she often hid. To the modern eye, Mortimer's work -- by turns unsettling and hilarious -- is nothing short of a revolution in guidebook writing: here, at last, is irritable-bowel-syndrome-as-travelogue.

Such scholarly persistence has earned him good will from the theater community and enviable attention from the press; Encores! has one of the best rave-to-pan ratios of any company in town.

The makeup maestro Dick Page, who worked on both shows, tends to blend a soft rose lipstick on the apple of the cheek, but believes that women used to working with a powder blush should stick to powder.

Page likes cream blush for a healthy flush; the makeup artist Fulvia Farolfi uses Est\u00e9e Lauder's Minute Blush for a very creamy look. Either way, you don't have to go to the gym.    EITHER-OR LIPS  There's no middle ground for pouts this season: it's either nude or burgundy. Page warns that truly nude lips like those at Marc Jacobs and Missoni can make the best-intentioned woman look ''dead and buried.'' So opt for something with warmth. Begin with a concealer (Shiseido's concealer pencil or Yves Saint Laurent's light beige lip pencil) and top with gloss (Lanc\u00f4me's or Clinique's). For dressier occasions, emulate the deep berry mouths at Louis Vuitton, Donna Karan and Carolina Herrera. Page says women who don't wear dark shades should use a stain, like Vincent Longo's. But for a full-strength smacker, begin with a lip pencil and use a brush to spread lipstick (real reds from Yves Saint Laurent or Revlon) all over the surface. Then blot and powder (with Laura Mercier's translucent loose) and repeat the lip brushing. Phew.    MOD IS IN THE DETAILS  Exaggerated Twiggy eyes, rimmed in black and white, popped up at the Chanel, Dior and Ungaro collections. Page thinks that women who lead their lives off the runway should opt for a pared-down rendition, preferably without the white. ''It's too costume to try at home,'' he says. The look of the 1960's requires liquid liner, which -- unless you have the hands of a surgeon -- usually results in an ugly space between lines and lashes. (For that exigency, Farolfi suggests the help of Revlon's user-friendly rubber-tipped liquid.) Page skips the liquid liner altogether, using instead an inexpensive eye shadow (like Wet 'n' Wild) on a small damp brush to work darkness into the lashes. ''It's more attractive than a razor-sharp line,'' he says. Amateurs, keep a pile of damp Q-tips handy.
