Why not make pumpkin-walnut cream cheese for the season? That's what he did -- nothing new for him. It just added to his noted repertory of creative cream cheeses: from olive-pimento to walnut-raisin to strawberry. Mr. Ingram, a former trucker, makes them at Dee's Bagel Cafe/Deli & Grill in Apple Plaza in Monroe. Outside the four-year-old establishment, diners are greeted by a smiling 6-foot-plus-tall wooden caricature of the 5-foot-3-inch former nail technician Denice (Dee) Ingram, John's wife. The wooden Dee is holding a hamburger, surrounded by a muffin, coffee and other goodies. Inside are sculptures of bagels that transmute into, for example, a tossed salad, a Danish, a bowl of soup. The Ingrams, who commute from Burlington Township, about a half-hour away, draw most of their patrons from the handful of adult communities in the township. At lunchtime, the cafe can serve up to 26 diners, many from surrounding businesses like a Sony warehouse, Aetna and Home Depot. There also is delivery for orders of at least $15. Lunch can be anything from salads and club, combo or deli sandwiches and wraps to baskets, burgers and grill -- all $4 to $6. Available any time, is a dish ($4.59) made from eggs, three cheeses, bacon and onions: the ''Deelux'' Cheese Omelette.

This is a well-done tribute to the legacy of one of the most important rock bands of the 90's, and at one point the biggest. At 18 tracks, the first disc in this two-CD set, titled ''Rotten Apples,'' initially seems to fall short, missing so many of the band's great songs, but that is not its purpose. It tracks a few standout songs (not always hits) from each CD by a band that always managed to be completely alternative- and mainstream-minded at the same time, never losing its artistic vision in the morass of success pressures and intra-band problems. The collection traces the evolution of Smashing Pumpkins from the intensely textural rock onslaught of its first albums to the pop grandiosity of its glory days to the more conceptual and stylistically far-reaching songs of its final years. For the second disc, I would have liked an official CD of the band's Internet-only album, ''Machina II.'' Instead, there is a disc called ''Judas O,'' which is an impressively high-quality collection of B-sides, tracks from ''Machina II'' and other rarities (a follow-up to a similar collection from 1994, ''Pisces Iscariot'').

SANDLER-Herman. It was Herman Sandler's altruism and generosity that first brought him into Sting's and my lives and the life of the Rain Forest Foundation. Every year he would come to the annual fund-raising concert at Carnegie Hall, bringing with him a huge party of colleagues and family, and donating very substantial sums to our cause. His support of my work extended to smaller projects, such as the Tibetan Peace Garden in London, and he championed my endeavors with huge interest, support and indefatigable energy. He was a joy to be with socially, a charismatic personality exuding a sense of fun and enthusiasm for life that shone from his boyish eyes. I will miss his company, I will miss trying to amuse him just to hear his wonderful infectious laughter. He imbued New York with his vital life force, and it's a smaller apple without him. We will always remember him. Trudie Styler and Sting    SANDLER-Herman S.

He married Patricia Dorothy McQuillen, also of Bronxville, in 1951. After completing his Ph.D. in American Literature at Brown University in 1953, he became an Assistant Professor of English at Brown and was later named Dean of the College. In 1963, at the age of 37, he was named President of Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he served for twelve years, leading the school through an important period of change and growth. Following his time at Bucknell, Mr. Watts returned to Brown University to help launch a major capital campaign. He then joined Beneficial Financial Corporation (later acquired by Household Finance) in the position of General Director. Mr. Watts, whose father, Charles H.

In the bright tented cafe, mornings start with homemade muffins packed with Jersey blueberries ($2), thick slices of apple-cinnamon-stuffed French toast ($5.95), Belgian waffles crowned with whipped cream and summer berries ($5.95), or fluffy omelets filled with your choice of cheese and farm stand vegetables ($4.25 to $5.50). Best of all, the warm staff keeps the freshly brewed coffee coming, with no need to ask for refills. If a sit-down breakfast is not your thing, head over to the cheese shop (stocked with 500 varieties) for a bagel and a schmear. Choose from a dozen cheese spreads (all made there) like Garden Vegetable, a blend of cream cheese, cheddar, peppers, scallions, and radishes, or Tijuana Hot, a blend of yellow cheddar and jalape\u00f1o, which will wake you up as surely as the coffee. For lunch, sandwiches like prosciutto, roasted peppers, and fresh mozzarella ($6.95) share menu space with juicy burgers. And for the bikinied crowd, there's a good selection of salads ($6.99 to $9.95). There's also a ''Light Nibbles'' menu with impressive little bites like bruschetta, crab cakes, prosciutto-and-melon wraps, and a nice fruit and cheese board. This is far from shore grub.

(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Heaney's new book of poems is a compendium of genres set in an array of forms and tuned to many kinds of experience, the work of a mature poet and world citizen, aware of his cultural authority as a public man and of the rights and responsibilities that go with it.    DOUBLE FOLD: Libraries and the Assault on Paper, by Nicholson Baker. (Random House, $25.95.) A jeremiad, a philippic, an imprecation against library professionals and all their friends who are bent on discarding books and newspapers made of genuine righteous paper while recording their contents on vile, accursed microfilm.    AFTERIMAGE, by Helen Humphreys. (Metropolitan/Holt, $23.) A Canadian writer's lyrical, alluring novel, a kind of gloss on the life of the Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron; the character at its heart, however, is a passionately self-educated housemaid from starving Ireland who serves as a model and as the prize in a family tug of war.    GRANT, by Jean Edward Smith. (Simon & Schuster, $35.) The author, a political scientist at Marshall University, takes issue with the conventional wisdom that Grant's presidency was an embarrassment to the nation, a judgment he attributes to the work of intellectual snobs like Henry Adams and of scholars who favored white supremacy.    AN UNEXPECTED LIGHT: Travels in Afghanistan, by Jason Elliot. (Picador USA, $30.) The author explores past and present, at considerable personal risk, in the Afghan resistance to Russia and in the collapse that preceded the Taliban rule of the present.    FACING THE WIND: A True Story of Tragedy and Reconciliation, by Julie Salamon. (Random House, $24.95.) A breathtaking account of a man who killed his wife and children and was found insane, but soon released from custody -- and of what happened after that, by a television critic for The Times.    HONEYMOON: And Other Stories, by Kevin Canty. (Nan A. Talese/ Doubleday, $21.) Elliptical, impressionistic short stories, in a style at once tender and telegraphic, featuring characters who do the wrong things for the wrong reasons; for starters, in the first story Godzilla declares his love for Tokyo.    REMEMBER ME TO HARLEM: The Letters of Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten, 1925-1964, edited by Emily Bernard. (Knopf, $30.) The record of an ironic, ribald, frequently poignant interracial friendship between a poet who interpreted the black experience and a novelist who did his best to promote Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance.    THREE APPLES FELL FROM HEAVEN, by Micheline Aharonian Marcom. (Riverhead, $23.95.) A vivid first novel placed in the Turkish massacres of Armenians during World War I; one character, an American consul, wonders, as the reader is meant to do, why such cruelties are so little noted by the world.

(Random House, $24.95.) This second volume of memoir by The Times's former restaurant critic invokes themes larger than mere food: commune life in Berkeley, the social texture of dining out, the longing for a child.    DOUBLE FOLD: Libraries and the Assault on Paper, by Nicholson Baker. (Random House, $25.95.) A jeremiad, a philippic, an imprecation against library professionals and all their friends who are bent on discarding books and newspapers made of genuine righteous paper while recording their contents on vile, accursed microfilm.    THE GARDENS OF KYOTO, by Kate Walbert. (Scribner, $24.) An elusive, eloquent first novel whose plot moves back and forth in America, Paris and Japan as its narrator, a woman coming of age in the 1950's, construes the past in a way that obscures some uncomfortable facts but never involves her in emotional dishonesty.    AFTERIMAGE, by Helen Humphreys. (Metropolitan/Holt, $23.) A Canadian writer's lyrical, alluring novel, a kind of gloss on the life of the Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron; the character at its heart, however, is a passionately self-educated housemaid from starving Ireland who serves as a model and as the prize in a family tug of war.    THE LAST REPORT ON THE MIRACLES AT LITTLE NO HORSE, by Louise Erdrich. (HarperCollins, $26.) A beguiling novel that takes place in Ojibwa country in North Dakota and centers on the innocence of Father Damien Modeste, a wilderness priest who lives for a century and is really a woman.    AN UNEXPECTED LIGHT: Travels in Afghanistan, by Jason Elliot. (Picador USA, $30.) The author explores past and present, at considerable personal risk, in the Afghan resistance to Russia and in the collapse that preceded the Taliban rule of the present.    THE MONEY AND THE POWER: The Making of Las Vegas and Its Hold on America, 1947-2000, by Sally Denton and Roger Morris. (Knopf, $26.95.) Las Vegas arraigned for drug trafficking, money laundering and politician corrupting, with quite a lot of evidence but little sense of why people have fun there.    ELECTRIC LIGHT, by Seamus Heaney. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Heaney's new book of poems is a compendium of genres set in an array of forms and tuned to many kinds of experience, the work of a mature poet and world citizen, aware of his cultural authority as a public man and of the rights and responsibilities that go with it.    FACING THE WIND: A True Story of Tragedy and Reconciliation, by Julie Salamon. (Random House, $24.95.) A breathtaking account of a man who killed his wife and children and was found insane, but soon released from custody -- and of what happened after that, by a television critic for The Times.

At the Yankee game, at Zabar's, in the subway, when we had drinks outside Tavern on the Green -- as long as we were in public and no matter how I beseeched him, the thick insulated leather gloves never came off. Finally, my girlfriend gave it a shot. ''You know, Mr. Fass,'' she said, ''it's much more likely that you'll get sick from wearing those gloves all day in this hot weather than if you took them off and exposed yourself to a little fresh air.'' Reluctantly, Dad took off his gloves. He was sick as a dog for two weeks.

A friend of mine arrived at the club without having arranged a golf game in advance, but he found three members about to tee off. He knew two of them, and the third was introduced as Perry Como, a new member. My friend, who always wanted to know everything about everyone, asked the man what his business was. The man said he was a singer, and my friend, thinking he was being spoofed, replied, ''If you're a singer, then I'm Rudy Vallee.'' When the new member insisted that he was a singer, my friend asked him to sing something, which he did. When he finished, my friend said, ''I still say if you're a singer, then I'm Rudy Vallee.'' Nothing more was said, but when my friend arrived home he asked his wife if she had ever heard of a singer named Perry Como. Her excited reply made him realize that he had made a mistake, and he prepared to apologize the next time they met. The following morning he returned to the club, and when he arrived at his locker he found the following message in large letters: ''GOOD MORNING RUDY VALLEE.''   Irving J. Volk      Phyllis Robbins was walking on the Upper East Side when she saw a woman looking into the windows of a fashionable shop while her dog strained at its leash.

The book is an ''adroit melding of biography and criticism'' that ''sparkles with intelligence, wit and human interest,'' Morris Dickstein wrote in the Book Review last year.    EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, by Zo Heller. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.) Willy Muller is a reptilian celebrity biographer, misanthrope and all-round scuzzy character haunted by the ghost of his estranged daughter, who before her suicide mailed him every journal she'd written since she was 9. Writing here last year, Jeff Giles called this ''an acerbic, sneakily touching novel'' that at its best ''calls to mind Martin Amis's phosphorescently nasty oeuvre.''    DARWIN'S WORMS, by Adam Phillips. (Basic Books, $13.) A noted British child psychotherapist reflects on Darwin's lifelong interest in earthworms and Freud's fascination with death, both of which offer cause for celebration in a world abandoned by God. ''Almost invariably lively and entertaining,'' Phillips's essays ''are directed as well toward instructing their audience,'' Steven Marcus said in these pages in 2000.    WINSTON AND CLEMENTINE: The Personal Letters of the Churchills. Edited by Mary Soames. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $16.) Winston Churchill and his wife, Clementine, were devoted pen pals throughout 57 years of marriage, as this huge volume edited by their daughter attests. His ''manly, buoyant style is displayed to great effect,'' Thomas Mallon wrote here in 1999, while ''Clementine . . . can bring Nancy Mitford to mind.'' Churchill Wanted Dead or Alive, by Celia Sandys (Carroll & Graf, $14), is a colorful account of the young Churchill's experiences as a newspaper correspondent in the Boer War, including his escape from a prisoner of war camp. The ''fascinating narrative,'' as put together by his granddaughter, ''may be the romantic stuff of Victorian adventure fiction, but it has the virtue of being true,'' David Murray wrote here in 2000.    AFRICAN FOLKTALES: Traditional Stories of the Black World. Selected and retold by Roger D. Abrahams. (Pantheon, $18.) An accomplished Africanist plumbs the oral tradition of tribal families throughout the sub-Sahara in this revised anthology of earthy and comedic tales of magic, sultans, ghosts, lovers and animals that behave like people. ''The result is a rousing good read,'' Jason Berry said in the Book Review in 1983.    A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER, by David Liss. (Ballantine, $14.) This engaging first novel revolves around a mixed bag of 18th-century characters at the time of the South Sea Bubble, the first stock market crash in the English-speaking world. ''What makes 'A Conspiracy of Paper' so readable is that Liss manages to create a number of arresting side plots featuring everything from the London underworld to boxing to social mores to English anti-Semitism,'' James Polk wrote in these pages last year.    THE BLIND SIDE OF THE HEART, by Michael C. White. (Cliff Street/HarperCollins, $13.) The narrator of this unconventional whodunit is Maggie Quinn, a blunt-spoken housekeeper who wrestles with drink and doubt when her employer, a Roman Catholic priest who once rescued her sanity, is indicted for the murder of an altar boy they both loved. In 1999 our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, admired ''the cruel beauty'' of White's ''spare, unflinching prose.''    MORMON AMERICA: The Power and the Promise, by Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. (HarperSanFrancisco, $17.) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, founded by an itinerant treasure hunter from upstate New York in 1830, has a global membership of more than 10 million. This primer, which sorts through the doctrines and practices of the Mormon faith, ''is eminently fair, well researched and exhaustive,'' Timothy Egan wrote here last year.    THE MAGIC KINGDOM, by Stanley Elkin. (Dalkey Archive, $12.95.) In this crazy quilt of a novel, a man mourning the loss of his 12-year-old son leads a group of terminally ill children on a trip from England to Disney World. ''Part sick joke, part lyrical meditation on the nature of disease,'' the comic tale ''is both hysterical and profound,'' Max Apple said here in 1985.

Mr. Sullivan's gift is for locating and sharpening the dramatic pitch of a playwright's work, as a respectful conductor would do for a composer.", "abstract": "Bruce Weber reviews Shaw's Major Barbara, revived by Roundabout Theater; Daniel Sullivan directs production starring Cherry Jones, Dana Ivey and David Warner; photos (M)", "print_page": "1", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Shavian Artillery Levels Hypocrisy", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THEATER REVIEW; Shavian Artillery Levels Hypocrisy", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Roundabout Theater Co", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Ivey, Dana", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Sullivan, Daniel", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Shaw, George Bernard", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Warner, David", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Jones, Cherry", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Reviews", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Major Barbara (Play)", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2001-07-13T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "section_name": "Movies", "byline": {"original": "By Bruce Weber", "person": [{"firstname": "Bruce", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Weber", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/b6089cd1-f077-5877-8e67-cd785bbff17b", "word_count": 1558, "uri": "nyt://article/b6089cd1-f077-5877-8e67-cd785bbff17b"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/03/books/best-sellers-june-3-2001.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "Weeks", "abstract": "                   Weeks     This   Last   On     Week   Week   List   Fiction                 1   2   2   CHOSEN PREY, by John Sandford.

In Roslyn Harbor, the Nassau County Museum of Art focuses on ''Reflections of Opulence: Art Nouveau to Art Deco.'' The show, which opens today, examines the dramatic transformation in the fine and decorative arts from the lush turn-of-the-century nouveau to the simplified, angular forms of deco that appeared in the 1920's.

Mornings did not pass without his sitting at his desk on the 66th floor of 1 World Trade Center and sending pages to his wife in a special code all their own.    If Deborah Perkins-Williams saw 381 come across her pager, she knew it was an ''I love you.''

Opera    GLIMMERGLASS OPERA. Once again, the Alice Busch Opera Theater, the home of the adventurous Glimmerglass Opera's summer festival, is itself one of the best reasons to travel to Cooperstown (a four-hour drive from New York City). This 900-seat theater is near ideal for opera. The offerings this summer are interesting, as always. Britten's gritty chamber opera ''The Rape of Lucretia'' has been staged grippingly by Christopher Alden. The Male and Female who narrate and comment upon the story (William Burden and Christine Goerke) are here portrayed as a sullen couple sitting on a couch in roughly the time of the opera's composition, the mid-1940's. As they tell the tale of envy, lust and rape in pagan Rome, they interact with the characters with whom they eerily identify. Michelle DeYoung as Lucretia and Nathan Gunn as the menacing Etruscan prince Tarquinius give powerful performances. Handel's ''Agrippina,'' a satirical telling of the story of the Emperor Claudius's wife, who tries to get him to name Nero, her son from a previous marriage, as heir, gets a suitably witty, imaginative and compelling staging here. The cast members look and act better than they sing. But the opera is a masterpiece, and the show is enjoyable. The strongest members of the cast of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' are Joyce Guyer as the forlorn, fragile and dignified Countess and Christopher Schaldenbrand as the preening, sexually voracious and dangerously handsome Count. Dean Ely and Nicole Heaston as Figaro and Susanna are also admirable. The director Stephen Lawless keeps confusing the narrative by making points. Still, it's an imaginative production. Finally, Chabrier's comic opera ''L'&#201;toile,'' one of the best-kept secrets of 19th-century opera, a harmonically rich and musically refined score, is almost spoiled by Mark Lamos's directing. He encouraged the cast to deliver the spoken lines and bound about the stage with annoying comic exaggeration. Still, with its gleaming Art Deco sets and colorful costumes, the production looks great. And the music, conducted by Stewart Robertson, is a marvel. ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' tonight at 8; ''L'&#201;toile,'' tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.; ''Agrippina,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''The Rape of Lucretia,'' Sunday at 2 p.m. Alice Busch Opera Theater, Glimmerglass Opera, Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255.

The new Aurangabad has modern factories and broad, brilliantly lighted commercial streets and houses as big as hotels and health clubs and cybercafes and Chinese restaurants and even, in what is widely considered the single deepest incursion of cosmopolitan culture, a Domino's Pizza. I used to take great pride in Aurangabad's authentic ordinariness -- no god-men or yogic celebrities, no elephants, princes, movie stars or hippies. Aurangabad was the real India. And it still is, but the real India is a very different, and very much more differentiated, place than it used to be. In 1976, when I arrived, India was understood to consist of an enormous number of terribly poor people, a tiny sliver of the jet-setting rich and a middle stratum consisting largely of civil servants. This stratum is now known retrospectively as ''the old middle class.'' The public servants, or babus, were a governing class, not a consuming class; there was, in any case, scarcely anything to consume, since import and license restrictions ensured that all but the jet-setters had to content themselves with an extremely limited range of generally rather shoddy domestic merchandise.
