Among other benefits, it can keep multiple Macs, PCs and iPhones in sync. E-mail, calendars and address books are wirelessly kept up to date. Very cool idea.  When I started testing it on July 10, there were a lot of glitches, especially with the Web-based address book, calendar and e-mail programs. Apple told me that it was having some technical problems, but that they were rapidly being solved. And sure enough, by the 14th, several days after the launch, I was really pounding on it, and it worked as advertised.  Well, actually, not quite \"as advertised.\" Apple was saying the service offered \"push\" e-mail, calendar and contacts, meaning that changes were propagated instantly among devices. In fact, as I noted in my review, Macs and PCs don't check for updates any more frequently than every 15 minutes. Otherwise, though, the system works very well \u2014 for me \u2014 and it's extremely useful.  On July 16, Apple took the very unusual step of sending an apology to all MobileMe members, saying that the launch \"was a lot rockier than we had hoped.\" Fortunately, the letter went on, \"we have worked through those problems and the Web apps are now up and running.\"  It also said that Apple would stop using the word \"push\" in its advertising until Macs and PCs did their syncing nearly instantly. It concluded with an apology, and a free one-month extension to every member's subscription.  Unfortunately, MobileMe's problems were nowhere near over.  After my review appeared, a strange note showed up on the MobileMe support Web site: \"1% of MobileMe members cannot access MobileMe Mail. We apologize for this service interruption and are working hard to resolve the problem.\"  Now, even if 1 percent is accurate, Apple has 2 million .Mac/MobileMe customers. So that's at least 20,000 people.   And just about every one of them e-mailed me.  For most of them, the e-mail features of MobileMe just don't work. The online Mail program at Me.com shows up empty; mail you try to send from your e-mail program never goes out; and messages sent to you get bounced.  For a few, it's a lot worse. \"This morning, I woke up and turned on my computer,\" wrote one reader. \"Happily, it seemed that the MobileMe e-mail service was back up. However, a few seconds later, when my computer synced with .Mac/MobileMe, ALL of my e-mail -- every single e-mail I've ever sent, received, and filed on .Mac -- disappeared. Every e-mail file on my hard drive (in the Mail library) was gone. I immediately went to Me.com to make sure that all my e-mail was still saved to Apple's server. It wasn't. All of the mail was gone.\"  Apple escalated her case and dedicated top technicians to it, for which she was grateful. In the end, however, they recovered only 43 messages. The rest are gone forever.  \"I can't even begin to describe how unnerving, enraging, unbelievable and frustrating it is to have thousands of e-mails that I rely on disappear -- from a service that I'm paying for,\" she wrote me.  As days went by with no change, the disastrous launch began taking on a life of its own. Small-business owners lost money because they couldn't get e-mail from their customers. The Apple support Web site filled up with messages from apoplectic customers. People started calling it \"ImmobileMe\" and \"MobileMess.\"  MobileMe tech support, my correspondents tell me, is nearly impossible to reach; the recording says that the support team is \"unavailable due to the overwhelming interest in MobileMe.\" (Somehow I doubt that \"overwhelming interest\" is the problem.) When you do reach them, they're apologetic but can do nothing to help.  O.K., look: Even big companies screw up. Intel's done it. Microsoft's done it. Google's done it.   Maybe it wasn't such a hot idea for Apple to launch four enormously complex initiatives \u2014 the iPhone 3G, the App Store, the iPhone 2.0 software update and MobileMe \u2014 all on the same day.   Still, things can go wrong. We get that.  And it's a little mind-boggling that today, nearly two weeks after MobileMe's official opening, Apple still hasn't solved the problem. That's got to be a record in the short history of cloud computing.   But the real problem is how Apple is responding. For a company that's so brilliant at marketing, it seems to have absolutely no clue about crisis management.  One of my correspondents put it like this: \"I love Apple. My first computer ever was a 128K Macintosh. But the lack of explanation and communication on the MobileMe problem is outrageous. Why not update the status message? Why not give us some indication of what's going on?\"   I called Apple. Would the P.R. team be willing to say what the problem is? What is being done to solve it? When might it be fixed? What kind of resources or time is being spent on a resolution?  No. Apple declined to comment on any of that.  A P.R. manager did, however, offer me this official statement: \"The .Mac to MobileMe transition was a lot rockier than we had hoped, and we are still having some growing pains. Some users have been having problems with their e-mail in particular, and we are trying to restore the service as soon as possible. We're very thankful for our loyal customers' patience as we work out the kinks.\"   Shortly thereafter, that stale, static status message on the MobileMe site was expanded to include this: \"We understand this is a serious issue and apologize for this service interruption. We are working hard to restore your service.\"  That's about as far as Apple will go in expressing an understanding of the emotional toll the outage is causing those 20,000 people.   It's amazing that Apple doesn't recognize this situation. This is an airplane that's stuck on the runway for hours with no food or working bathroom. And the pilot doesn't come on the P.A. system to tell the customers what the problem is, what's being done to fix it, how much longer they might be stuck, and how he empathizes with their plight. Instead, he comes on once every three hours to repeat the same thing: \"We apologize for the inconvenience.\"  MobileMess, indeed.

It\u2019s stealing market share from Microsoft and its stock has outpaced Google\u2019s. But there have also been dramatic stumbles.", "lead_paragraph": "For Apple, these are the best of times and the worst of times.  The Cupertino, Calif., consumer electronics company is on a tear like never before. It's winning market share from Microsoft, enough to persuade the software giant to embark on a costly ad campaign that's being described as a belated response to Apple's Vista-baiting Get-a-Mac ads. Apple stock has outpaced Google's, and in the space of a year the iPhone has turned the telecommunications industry in a knot trying to find a way to respond.  But there have also been dramatic stumbles. A botched introduction of MobileMe -- the company's new data-synching service -- has led Apple to make repeated offers of free services to frustrated customers. And there have been teething problems for its generally well-received 3G iPhone, including flaky reception and weak battery life. Last week, the company apparently offered a software patch for a festering Achilles' heel that caused repeated freezes in the Macbook Air, more than seven months after customers began complaining about the problem.  That in turn has engendered a spate of coverage suggesting that somehow Apple's shine is fading, that somehow the once-invincible computer maker has suddenly developed a new-found talent for writing shoddy code. It is an interesting narrative, but unfortunately it doesn't fit the facts.   The flaw in the \"Apple is not living up to some ideal of technology perfection\" theme is that it neglects history.   Like Microsoft and every other major software and hardware maker, Apple has had its share of blunders going all the way back to the days when it struggled to remain the dominant PC maker as the business PC first appeared on the horizon.  For example, the story of the failure of the Apple III is a classic. Introduced more than a year before the I.B.M. PC in 1980, the III was intended for the new class of business users who were clamoring to use PCs for word processing, spreadsheets and databases in the office. Apple already had a leg up in business world with VisiCalc, the de facto standard in spreadsheets.   Unfortunately, the III turned out to be a manufacturing calamity, and at one point Apple issued a technical note suggesting that customers could make the machine work by simply dropping it three inches onto a desktop in order to re-seat chips that would come loose. There were other problems as well: a clock circuit that would fail and a PC board that had been incorrectly designed.  In all likelihood, a successful Apple III (there were some great aspects to the machine, which featured a new operating system called Apple SOS, or Sophisticated Operating System) would have redrawn the history of the PC industry. It would have made it much harder for I.B.M. to push its way into the business world with the first I.B.M. PC.  Things weren't perfect in the Macintosh era, either. Loyal Macintosh users still cringe at the mention of the System 6 version of the Macintosh OS. Introduced in 1988, it was incompatible with many existing Macintosh software programs and came with a number of troublesome bugs.  Who can forget the Apple Newton's inability to recognize handwriting? It took months of struggle by the system's designers -- after the first-generation Newton was released -- to achieve passable handwriting recognition performance. By then, the P.D.A.'s brand had been irreparably damaged, as had the reputation of its champion, Apple's then-chief executive, John Sculley.  It was Apple's failure to complete its ambitious \"Copland\" operating system in the 1990s that led to a series of events that brought Steven Jobs back to Apple, along with his Nextstep operating system, developed during his exile from Apple that began in 1986.  Apple is many things -- but it isn't any more likely to create technically perfect products than its competitors.

Two weeks after launch, at least 20,000 customers still had no way to send or receive e-mail.   The worst part, though, was Apple's smug silence on the issue. What was causing the problem? How come a fix was taking so long? What was being done to solve it? When would it be fixed? What kind of resources were being spent on a resolution? Did Apple understand the disruption this problem was causing those thousands of people and small businesses?  Apple wouldn't say.   There was a terse note on the MobileMe support site: \"1% of MobileMe members cannot access MobileMe Mail. We apologize for this service interruption and are working hard to resolve the problem.\" But otherwise, there was no communication whatsoever, no acknowledgment of people's growing desperation, even two weeks after MobileMe's launch.  And then, on Saturday\u2014well, knock me down with a feather. Apple performed a complete 180-degree reversal. The most opaque, uncommunicative tech company on the planet suddenly became transparent and informative.   At Steve Jobs's direction, the company has launched a new blog that's exclusively dedicated to the MobileMe mess.  In the first posting alone, Apple identifies the specific cause of the MobileMe problem (blockage from a bad mail server); what's being done to solve it (24/7 coordinated efforts); current status (e-mail service restored, but e-mail older than Friday is still missing, and one-tenth of messages sent between July 16 and 18 may be forever lost); the severity of the original problem (70 bugs fixed); and estimated time of completion (end of the week).   More amazingly, the blog acknowledges, for the first time, the emotional toll of the experience. \"It's been a rocky road, and we know the pain some people have been suffering.\"  I'll bet good money that Apple has never before used the words \"pain\" and \"suffering\" to describe one of its products.  What made Apple change its stance? Was it the thousands of people on its support boards, clamoring for accountability? Did my column have anything to do with it? Or was it just Steve Jobs coming back from vacation?   I can't remember any tech company ever willing to bare its ugly internal problems quite so publicly, and with so frank an admission of the distress it was causing. [UPDATE: I overstated that. Readers have pointed out similar notes from other companies, like this one, that do document internal problems, although without the acknowledgment of customer suffering.] These days, my e-mail is filled with notes from customers, expressing relief and a huge stress reduction.  It would have been a lot better if MobileMe had worked great from Day One. It would have been better if Apple had been this candid from the beginning.  But at least Apple has finally provided what thousands of people have been aching for: honesty, transparency, and, above all, a sympathetic ear.

It was able to rewrite its entire operating system for the Intel platform in secret over several years by dividing the task up into several groups who were not allowed to communicate with each other.   But Apple's penchant for secrecy sometimes is expressed in ridiculous extremes. For example, it made people who used its software development kit for the iPhone, which is wide release, sign non-disclosure agreements. Among other effects, this appeared to make it impossible to write a book about how to develop applications for the iPhone.   Today Apple relented a bit. It announced that it would no longer enforce its non-disclosure agreement for software it has released:   The NDA has created too much of a burden on developers, authors and others interested in helping further the iPhone's success.   Software that hasn't been released is still covered by the agreement.   That certainly sounds like a sensible distinction: Companies have a right to keep things that are secret a secret, but once the cat is out of the bag, it can't be a secret any more.  There have been an increasing number developers complaining that Apple is making it too hard for developers, such as in this blog post on Ars Technica.   Despite its Soviet style of communication, Apple is certainly signaling that it understands that needs to keep its developers\u2014some of its most fervent advocates\u2014from becoming so angry they will switch their efforts to Google's Android or other projects.   Earlier this week, Apple tweaked a few policies that had made some developers feel that the marketplace in the iTunes App store was unfair. Now you have to have bought the application to be able to review it. And a developer can't simply make a minor modification in a program to jump to the top of the list of new applications.   At the same time, Apple still hasn't answered in any clear way what applications it will reject because they compete with its existing business. And it hasn't reversed its recent decision to argue that its decision to reject an application is covered by the non-disclosure agreement.   Ultimately, Apple has chosen to make its business a bit more like that of eBay: It now has to manage a diverse crew of independent entrepreneurs who rely on its ecosystem for their livelihood. Like eBay sellers, iPhone developers are going to be very vocal about all of the nuances of Apple's program. That is very different than simply making a computer that anyone can write programs for without asking permission.   It is not clear how much of Apple's culture of secrecy and control will really evolve to support this new aspect of its business model. But the pressure is on.

The bigger question is how Apple handles the slowdown.", "lead_paragraph": "Apple investors freaked out Monday, in part because two Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock. They are worried that margins will be compressed and sales of Macintosh computers and iPhones will be less than expected.   Apple's shares fell $22.34, or 17.4 percent, to $105.90 Monday. That compares with a 6.8 percent drop for Hewlett-Packard and a 6.4 percent fall for Dell.   How Apple handles the substantial turbulence among consumers is, in fact, a major test of its strategy and momentum. When Apple publishes its third-quarter results and -- even more -- its sales for the holiday season, we'll see how its premium-priced product line holds up in tougher times. Will people still pay more for the style and ease of use of a Mac when they are worried about paying the mortgage and filling the tank in the minivan?   When a company has had the kind of business success that Apple has enjoyed over the last five years, its stock certainly can drop like Wile E. Coyote after zooming off the side of a cliff.   But after the smoke clears, the bigger question is how special is Apple now? How much will it continue to have better margins and better growth than its rivals?   I suspect this depends on two main factors:   First is Apple's ability to maintain the premium pricing of its computer and iPod lines. And second is its ability to morph the stagnant iPod business into more rapidly growing product lines.   Apple has done amazingly well using the dominance of the iPod and some sleek technology to maintain substantially higher prices than its rivals.   A recession represents a major peril for a premium brand. There's a temptation to cut prices to maintain sales. But sometimes it's better to let sales fall than to cheapen your image so much that the halo is lost when the market rebounds.   One current in the wide river of Apple rumors has been about a lower-priced line of computers. Apple's premium in both desktops and laptops is so high that I suspect it can introduce new models at lower price points without looking like the bargain basement. But we'll have to see.   Apple's pricing for its new line of iPods shows a fair bit of confidence. It kept the $149 entry price point for the Nano line, its most popular. It did drop the starting price point for the Touch to $229 from $299, presumably in an effort to lure more people to step up to the more expensive model. Of course, there is no reason that Apple couldn't drop prices on a model or two between now and Thanksgiving if things are really slow.   Apple has long had a strong and clear approach to pricing, and I wouldn't bet that it gets too far out of whack even in this crazy time.   The future of the music, video and phone business is much harder to gauge. The growth of the standalone music-player business is slowing. The iPhone has had a great start, but it is still unclear how big of a business it can build for phones and other multi-function connected devices (like the Touch). How important this question becomes depends on how much the market for stand-alone audio and video players declines. Some people will still want stand-alone players; some will want all-in-one devices. We don't know the balance, but I assume that Apple's share of dedicated media players will always be higher than its share of phones.   The other potential new market is for video in the living room. Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, has described its Apple TV product as a hobby. I'd describe it more as an option. Because of Apple's brand, its position in music and its iPod video business, Apple has as good a position as anyone to be a player in Internet-delivered video. So far, this hasn't been significant, but it still could be.   There are some rumors flying around that Apple is going to change its Apple TV offering Tuesday. That's not crazy, as the line hasn't changed in a while. But there certainly are no signs of any major announcement. But this is Apple, so who knows.   All in, if I were an Apple investor, I would be more concerned about how Apple reacts to the consumer slowdown that simply the fact that demand may be off somewhat.

He was encouraged because he had written a few dozen Web-based applications that worked with the first-generation iPhone, all of which were promoted by Apple's Web site. And he was quickly approved when he applied to download the iPhone software development kit, unlike many who faced inexplicable delays.   On Aug. 14, Mr. Sokirynsky submitted his application to be distributed through Apple's Web store. It was his turn for an inexplicable delay. Last week, Apple finally contacted him, saying it would not distribute Podcaster. \"Since Podcaster assists in the distribution of podcasts, it duplicates the functionality of the Podcast section of iTunes,\" Apple said, according to Mr. Sokirynsky's blog.   This is very curious. Yes, the iTunes software does allow users to download podcasts to their personal computers and transfer them onto their iPhones. But Mr. Sokirynsky's application does two different things: It allows people to stream podcasts over a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. And it allows them to download podcast files wirelessly to watch or listen to them later. These are both functions I'd love to see in iTunesthe iPhone, but they are not there yet.   Moreover, Apple allows all sorts of apps that duplicate various aspects of its own software. For example, several developers offer versions of the Apple Contacts application that manages names and phone numbers. There are downloads that similarly overlap with Apple's maps, stocks, weather and photo viewer applications.   Much more significantly, Apple has allowed music streaming applications that directly compete with its music download business, such as Pandora and LastFM Internet radio. When I spoke to Tom Conrad, the chief technical officer of Pandora, shortly after the launch of the iPhone App store, he told me that he saw no signs that Apple was worried about competition.   There are even a bunch of applications that allow for the streaming of podcasts, sometimes among other functions, including vSnax, Stitcher Radio and Truveo. There is an application meant solely for watching the Diggnation podcast. (These other applications don't offer to download podcast files, as Podcaster does.)   What is more, Apple has denied that it is motivated by thwarting competition even when that appears to be what it is doing. For example, it says it doesn't ban Adobe's Flash player from the iPhone to favor its own QuickTime software; it argues that Flash uses too much processing power for the phone.   So does Apple actually have rules or standards for what iPhone applications are and aren't allowed to do? It hasn't published any. It didn't give any helpful information to Mr. Sokirynsky suggesting how he might change the application.   So far, Apple won't say. I first sent an inquiry Friday afternoon to Natalie Kerris, the head of Apple's iPhone PR department, asking what the standards are. She quickly wrote back, saying, \"I'm not familiar with this particular app, so let me look into it.\"   On Monday, Ms. Kerris did not respond to several phone calls and e-mail messages.   In the mean time, Mr. Sokirynsky is trying to sell Podcaster through a complex back door, which Apple calls \"ad hoc distribution.\"   I bought Podcaster and it seems rather handy.   I can't see how distributing the program will hurt Apple. If anything it will make the iPhone a tad more valuable. On the other hand, treating developers capriciously is most certainly going to discourage them from spending nights and weekends working on new and useful applications that may give more people reasons to buy an iPhone.

The bigger question is how Apple handles the slowdown.", "lead_paragraph": "Apple investors freaked out Monday, in part because two Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock. They are worried that margins will be compressed and sales of Macintosh computers and iPhones will be less than expected.   Apple's shares fell $22.34, or 17.4 percent, to $105.90 Monday. That compares with a 6.8 percent drop for Hewlett-Packard and a 6.4 percent fall for Dell.   How Apple handles the substantial turbulence among consumers is, in fact, a major test of its strategy and momentum. When Apple publishes its third-quarter results and -- even more -- its sales for the holiday season, we'll see how its premium-priced product line holds up in tougher times. Will people still pay more for the style and ease of use of a Mac when they are worried about paying the mortgage and filling the tank in the minivan?   When a company has had the kind of business success that Apple has enjoyed over the last five years, its stock certainly can drop like Wile E. Coyote after zooming off the side of a cliff.   But after the smoke clears, the bigger question is how special is Apple now? How much will it continue to have better margins and better growth than its rivals?   I suspect this depends on two main factors:   First is Apple's ability to maintain the premium pricing of its computer and iPod lines. And second is its ability to morph the stagnant iPod business into more rapidly growing product lines.   Apple has done amazingly well using the dominance of the iPod and some sleek technology to maintain substantially higher prices than its rivals.   A recession represents a major peril for a premium brand. There's a temptation to cut prices to maintain sales. But sometimes it's better to let sales fall than to cheapen your image so much that the halo is lost when the market rebounds.   One current in the wide river of Apple rumors has been about a lower-priced line of computers. Apple's premium in both desktops and laptops is so high that I suspect it can introduce new models at lower price points without looking like the bargain basement. But we'll have to see.   Apple's pricing for its new line of iPods shows a fair bit of confidence. It kept the $149 entry price point for the Nano line, its most popular. It did drop the starting price point for the Touch to $229 from $299, presumably in an effort to lure more people to step up to the more expensive model. Of course, there is no reason that Apple couldn't drop prices on a model or two between now and Thanksgiving if things are really slow.   Apple has long had a strong and clear approach to pricing, and I wouldn't bet that it gets too far out of whack even in this crazy time.   The future of the music, video and phone business is much harder to gauge. The growth of the standalone music-player business is slowing. The iPhone has had a great start, but it is still unclear how big of a business it can build for phones and other multi-function connected devices (like the Touch). How important this question becomes depends on how much the market for stand-alone audio and video players declines. Some people will still want stand-alone players; some will want all-in-one devices. We don't know the balance, but I assume that Apple's share of dedicated media players will always be higher than its share of phones.   The other potential new market is for video in the living room. Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, has described its Apple TV product as a hobby. I'd describe it more as an option. Because of Apple's brand, its position in music and its iPod video business, Apple has as good a position as anyone to be a player in Internet-delivered video. So far, this hasn't been significant, but it still could be.   There are some rumors flying around that Apple is going to change its Apple TV offering Tuesday. That's not crazy, as the line hasn't changed in a while. But there certainly are no signs of any major announcement. But this is Apple, so who knows.   All in, if I were an Apple investor, I would be more concerned about how Apple reacts to the consumer slowdown that simply the fact that demand may be off somewhat.

Like almost all Apple events in recent memory, the announcement has been preceded by a growing crescendo of leaks from Apple fan Web sites. Several weeks ago, word that a new manufacturing process for laptop cases was in the works, and there was widespread speculation about what the word \"brick\" would mean.  Previously, speculation has centered on a new design, derived from the Macbook Air, which the company introduced earlier this year at its annual MacWorld conference.   Now, however, economics and price will probably get more attention than the company's latest industrial design. One site reported that the entry price of a Macbook laptop would fall to $799, potentially a drop of $300.  In July, after an unusually strong quarter, Apple's chief financial officer teased analysts with hints that the company was preparing to introduce a new class of products that would give the rest of the consumer electronics industry fits.  The company is planning on taking away what Peter Oppenheimer, the company's chief financial officer, called an ''umbrella for our competitors.''  Since then, there have been a variety of leaks suggesting that the word \"brick\" refers to a lower-cost manufacturing process for the company's sleek cases, although given Mr. Oppenheimer's description, it is unlikely that a new case could give Apple any unmatchable advantage.  It remains to be seen whether the new computers will give the quirky consumer electronics firm enough of a boost to carry it through what is promising to be a catastrophic Christmas for most of its competitors. The company's stock has literally been in free fall in the current Wall Street crises, dropping from a 52-week high of $202.96, to $92.14 at last glance.

In honor of that, I thought I'd look at a remark that a friend recently made: \"We spend so much time wailing about extinction, but we never celebrate new species.\"  (Photo: Hand-colored lithograph of passenger pigeons from J. J. Audubon's \"The Birds of America.\" (The New York Public Library)) Good point. But there are several reasons for the asymmetry. The most obvious is that extinction is easier to see. In the 18th century, the passenger pigeon was one of the most numerous birds on earth. Flocks of birds several miles long would fly over, blocking out the sun like an immense cloud. Some observers said the effect was like an eclipse. But by 1880, the numbers had plummeted; by 1915, the passenger pigeon had gone.  The appearance of a new species is not so dramatic. The first members of a new species will typically be indistinguishable \u2014 to us \u2014 from the species they have evolved from. And while extinction has a clear final moment \u2014 the last member of a species dies \u2014 the formation of a new species does not usually happen in a single recognizable instant. Which is why we haven't yet raised our glasses to celebrate, say, Rhagoletis pomonella, the apple maggot fly.   (Photo: Rhagoletis pomonella, the apple maggot fly. (Wikimedia Commons)) This species is in the process of splitting into two. Until the mid-1800s, R. pomonella was a hawthorn fly: adults met at hawthorn fruits to mate and lay eggs. But then apples were introduced to North America. Some haw flies found these fruits attractive places to gather, and began to mate and lay their eggs on apples instead.   Today, flies that like apples have become genetically distinct from those that like haw. There are a couple of reasons why. First, flies meet each other at fruits. Since most flies have a preference for one fruit over the other, haw-preferring flies tend to meet other haw-preferring flies, and ditto for apple flies.   These mating preferences are reinforced by differences in how well the flies survive. Attributes that help maggots survive on haw are different from those that promote survival on apples. Apple trees produce fruits earlier than hawthorn, and apple-specialists must thus emerge from their pupae earlier, or they risk missing the fruit. Emergence is under genetic control, so you might expect that apple flies and haw flies would have genes that predispose them to emerge at different times \u2014 and they do. As a consequence, if, say, an apple fly should happen to go to a haw instead and mate with a haw fly, their offspring will have a mix of haw and apple genes. It will thus be poorly suited to both fruits and less likely to survive.  So why don't we consider the apple specialists a new species? Because they aren't quite all the way there.   The most common way to define a species is a group of individuals that breed with each other successfully. For example, dogs, despite their vastly different looks, can breed with each other, so they are are considered one species. Horses and donkeys are counted as different species because their offspring (mules and hinnies) are sterile. For individuals to be considered as belonging to separate species thus means that they are \"reproductively isolated\": they can't, won't, or don't breed with each other.   I say, \"can't, won't, or don't\" because reproductive isolation can come about through any of these routes. Horses and donkeys are examples of \"can't.\" Although they can (and do) have sex, their genes are incompatible: they can't produce fertile offspring.   What about \"won't\"? Cichlid fish living in Lake Victoria. If you fertilize the eggs of one species of cichlid with the sperm of another, the eggs will develop and produce fertile fish. But in nature, this doesn't happen, because males and females from different species don't find each other beautiful: they won't mate with each other.   And \"don't\"? Here, the animals can still breed with each other, and will if they meet, but in nature this doesn't happen because they don't meet.   Haw and apple flies are in the \"don't\" category: flies from the different fruits don't mate because they don't meet. Usually. However, the preference that flies have for the different fruits is not quite perfect. From time to time, flies reared on apple will come to hawthorn to mate. And although the offspring of such a mating are less likely to survive, they aren't inviable or sterile. This means that there is still a low level of \"gene flow\" \u2014i.e., successful sex \u2014 between the two groups. But because offspring from such matings have a survival disadvantage, it seems likely that there will come a time when the separation will be complete, and we will be able to raise a cheer of welcome for the newly speciated apple maggot. Yippee!  I can sense your excitement. And perhaps that's the real reason we don't celebrate apple maggots, or any of the other new species (and there are many we know about) that are in the process of evolving. For when a new species does appear, it's just not that different from the old species. To evolve the flamboyant differences that distinguish a swan from a duck, or a human from a chimpanzee \u2014 that takes thousands, even millions, of years.

It all started with a mysterious phone call.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: The new iPod Nano was unveiled in September. (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images))   Will one of Apple's new iPod commercials propel a semi-obscure Brooklyn band into the national spotlight?  The technology and media company has done so with other independent acts -- earning it a reputation as a tastemaker, doing for bands what Oprah Winfrey has done for books.   While music heavies like Eminem, Bob Dylan and Wynton Marsalis have also been called upon for Apple ads, it's the independent musicians that have benefited most. A number of bands and singers have sold thousands of downloads, placed on Billboard charts and earned an international fan base after their songs were used for iPod commercials.  For these bands, the iPod is almost like an iGod.  The singer-songwriter Leslie Feist also had her catchy composition, \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" featured in an iPod Nano commercial last year, which lifted sales and helped secure her a highly coveted musical guest spot on \"Saturday Night Live.\"  Search queries like \"iPod Nano commercial song,\" \"iPod Nano song,\" and \"iPod Nano commercial\" all jumped more than 350 percent in one weekend, according to Yahoo. It seemed as if everyone wanted to know who possessed the raspy voice behind the \"1, 2, 3, 4.\"  And another song, \"Music is My Hot, Hot Sex,\" by a Brazilian band, CSS, was selected by an 18-year-old student in Britain for a homemade commercial for the iPod Touch.   That ad, which was originally posted on YouTube, was viewed by Apple's advertising agency, which invited the student to adapt it for a professional commercial broadcast during football games, during \"Desperate Housewives\" and in Game 4 of the World Series. That sent a year-old song by a foreign band onto the Pop 100 chart.  And an iPod Touch commercial features a song, \"Around the Bend\" by the Asteroids Galaxy Tour, which has garnered some fans already.  (Photo: Chairlift's debut album, \"Does You Inspire You.\")  Now the latest iPod Nano commercial uses a a psychedelic song, \"Bruises,\" performed by a Brooklyn band called Chairlift.   The band was formed two years ago by three friends -- Caroline Polachek performing vocals, Patrick Wimberly on drums, Aaron Pfenning on guitar -- who met at the University of Colorado. The band's first album, \"Does You Inspire You,\" is being released in November by Kanine Records, but elements of it have already been available on Amazon and iTunes.  The process of getting selected for an iPod commercial is hardly as open as an \"American Idol\" showdown.  \"We don't really know how they picked us,\" Mr. Wembley said. \"They contacted us out of the blue about three days before we were going to play in L.A.\" A man who said he was a representative for Apple said he wanted to see the band perform because the team was thinking of using a Chairlift song for a commercial.  \"We put him on the guest list,\" Mr. Wembley said. \"We didn't meet him or talk to him or talk to him directly. They're really secretive. They want to keep their new campaigns top secret, so top seret that they are not even letting the band know they are going to be the song on the commercial.\"  They saw the album pop up to to between No. 60 and 80 on iTunes. The \"Bruises\" single landed within the top 10 sellers in the alternative music category.  \"They have set themselves up as tastemakers when it comes to music,\" said Mr. Wembley, of Apple. That gives the band credibility despite the fact the song is being used in a commercial, albeit one for a music device and store. \"We wouldn't have done the commercial for anybody. We wouldn't have done an S.U.V. commercial.\"  In contrast, John Mellencamp caught flak from some of his fans for licensing his song, \"Our Country,\" for a Silverado spot that mixes images of the Statue of Liberty and Rosa Parks with footage from Hurricane Katrina and the Vietnam War.

But when a big city like New York tries something new, it's probably time to sit up and take notice.  (Photo: (Credit: Illustration and photography by dbox)) Which is what makes an announcement scheduled for Wednesday so interesting. The city's Department of Transportation has contracted with the Office for Visual Interaction, a lighting design group, to install and test L.E.D. street lighting. If the tests are successful, the city's entire stock of 300,000 street lamps could one day be replaced with L.E.D. versions.  As I discussed in a Times article last month, L.E.D. lighting has become all the rage, for a number of good reasons: power consumption is much lower than for standard bulbs; unlike compact fluorescents, no harmful chemicals are emitted when the bulbs are discarded; and L.E.D.'s can last more than 50,000 hours, obviating the need to have workers change the lights. (Insert your own bulb-changing joke here.)  The OVI contract is not just to switch the city's current crop of high-pressure sodium lamps for L.E.D.'s, but to introduce a completely redesigned lamp pole as well. Today's poles have become a designer's nightmare, with signs, traffic lights, control boxes and other accessories hung willy-nilly from them. The OSI approach envisions a sleek design that includes dedicated channels to hang the various accoutrements of city life.  In addition, up to four adjacent L.E.D. light sources and multiple lenses will direct the pole's light to different places; one unit may illuminate the street while an adjoining one will shine upon the sidewalk.  The bulbs themselves for this $1.175 million contract are being designed by Lighting Science Group and the company expects that for each pole and light source that is replaced, the payback period for the city will be two to three years. Not only will the city reduce its power usage 25 to 30 percent, but the bulbs will last 50,000 to 70,000 hours. Today's sodium lamps are rated at 24,000 hours, which means at that point half of them are dead. The L.E.D. life rating actually means that the bulb will drop below 70 percent of its original brightness after 50,000 hours or so.  But don't get too excited yet. This demonstration project will replace just six street lamp posts. The city has not decided which boroughs they'll be placed in, and there's no guarantee that it will decide to go with L.E.D.'s after the end of the testing period, which is expected to finish in the fall of next year.  Even if New York decides that L.E.D. lighting is the cat's pajamas, don't look for light bulb changing of every pole in town. Most likely, it will happen slowly, with a new L.E.D. pole put in place when an existing one fails, for example, because a motorist has plowed into one.

And do customers really care?", "lead_paragraph": "You've heard by now \u2013- because Apple news seems to travel faster than the broadband lines it's carried over -\u2013 that Steve Jobs & Co. are planning a Sept. 9 media event. While Apple has not disclosed the precise nature of said event, it would be hard for a sentient being not to conclude it is related to the iPod group of products. The event invitation is titled \"Let's Rock,\" and it features a silhouetted image from the company's iPod marketing campaign.  The blogosphere is teeming with related analysis and speculation, which travels one nanosecond slower than Apple news. Among the speculation:    Apple will unveil a new nano design  New iPods will have silicone skin  By Apple \"event\" standards, the announcement will be prosaic and banal   We at Bits will turn our speculative eye in a different direction \u2013- north, to Seattle. What, you're breathlessly wondering, might Microsoft have in mind for the Zune? (Surely, you continue to have a soft place in your heart for the Zune, which is sort of the Ron Paul of music players -\u2013 it has a small but passionate following and just enough of it to remain part of the discussion).  I happen to like the Zune just fine. I received one from Microsoft to test several months ago and found it a perfectly capable player, with nice sound quality and an easy-to-use online store. Good enough for me.   Others are less generous.  \"I have a wobbly table. The Zune fits perfectly under the broken leg,\" said Richard Doherty, a consumer electronics industry market researcher with Envisioneering. Mr. Doherty concedes that the Zune is a fine music player, but it's really just one among the pantheon of digital music players, and not even the second-best-selling after the iPod.  \"No name brands have sold tens of millions of players,\" he said, while Apple has sold \"north of 100 million iPods.\" (Microsoft said in May of this year it has sold 2 million Zunes.)  I asked Microsoft what might be next, and when. A spokesman for the company said the company has historically announced new products in the fall in advance of the holidays.  Mr. Doherty also expects an October announcement from Microsoft. Specifically, he thinks the new Zune players could have more memory, or there might be an upgrade to the online store.   Hardly the stuff of widespread blogospheric speculation. Makes one wonder why Microsoft remains in the game.   \"Zune isn't a business unit for Microsoft so much as it's an emotional unit,\" Mr. Doherty said.   Consumers may feel various emotions for the Zune, too, but the strongest one seems to be indifference.

Among the speculation:    Apple will unveil a new nano design  New iPods will have silicone skin  By Apple \"event\" standards, the announcement will be prosaic and banal   We at Bits will turn our speculative eye in a different direction \u2013- north, to Seattle. What, you're breathlessly wondering, might Microsoft have in mind for the Zune? (Surely, you continue to have a soft place in your heart for the Zune, which is sort of the Ron Paul of music players -\u2013 it has a small but passionate following and just enough of it to remain part of the discussion).  I happen to like the Zune just fine. I received one from Microsoft to test several months ago and found it a perfectly capable player, with nice sound quality and an easy-to-use online store. Good enough for me.   Others are less generous.  \"I have a wobbly table. The Zune fits perfectly under the broken leg,\" said Richard Doherty, a consumer electronics industry market researcher with Envisioneering. Mr. Doherty concedes that the Zune is a fine music player, but it's really just one among the pantheon of digital music players, and not even the second-best-selling after the iPod.  \"No name brands have sold tens of millions of players,\" he said, while Apple has sold \"north of 100 million iPods.\" (Microsoft said in May of this year it has sold 2 million Zunes.)  I asked Microsoft what might be next, and when. A spokesman for the company said the company has historically announced new products in the fall in advance of the holidays.  Mr. Doherty also expects an October announcement from Microsoft. Specifically, he thinks the new Zune players could have more memory, or there might be an upgrade to the online store.   Hardly the stuff of widespread blogospheric speculation. Makes one wonder why Microsoft remains in the game.   \"Zune isn't a business unit for Microsoft so much as it's an emotional unit,\" Mr. Doherty said.   Consumers may feel various emotions for the Zune, too, but the strongest one seems to be indifference.

What price and what product, however, was shrouded in the usual iMystery.", "lead_paragraph": "As usual, Apple didn't offer many specifics on its quarterly conference call with investors. But the company did hint that it has something really juicy to introduce before the end of September.   The tease came as Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's chief financial officer, explained why the company expects its gross profit margin to drop from 34.8 percent in the three months ended in June to 30 percent in the next quarter. One reason is a promotion that gives free iPods to students who buy new Macs. But another is \"a future product transition, which I can't discuss today.\"   Apple is widely expected to be getting ready to refresh its line of notebook computers, and there is some speculation that it may introduce a new form factor of devices that are smaller than a laptop but larger than an iPhone.    In several places, Apple executives hinted that this new product would offer price points that will beat the competition.    \"We will deliver state-of-the-art new products that our competitors just aren't going to be able to match,\" Mr. Oppenheimer said, responding to another question about the lower profit margin targets. And several times Tim Cook, the chief operating officer, repeated a bit about Apple's pricing philosophy.   \"One of the investments we make is to introduce new products that initially cost more because they delivery an entirely new level of value to the customer,\" Mr. Cook said. \"Then we ride the cost curves down with value engineering and volume manufacturing, leaving us far head of our competitors. We have some of these types of investments in front of us that I can't discuss. And we will continue to execute this strategy in the future.\"    It should be noted that for years, Apple really pursued a premium pricing strategy appropriate to its status as a niche vendor. The music player business, in which Apple has the dominant market share, moved the company toward a more mainstream pricing philosophy. The executives said that Apple's computers are priced more competitively now than at any time in the last few years   Low pricing was a key factor in the revival of Apple's sales of iPods, which have been sluggish recently. The company sold 11 million iPods in the most recent quarter, up 12 percent, more than analysts had expected. But iPod revenue only grew by 7 percent because most of the increase in sales came from the low-end Shuffle model. Apple cut the base price of the Shuffle to $49 early this year.    Mr. Cook also said the new $199 price was a key reason for the vigorous sales of the new iPhone 3G. The company's surveys, he said, showed that many potential customers were put off by the $399 price of the initial iPhone.   Not surprisingly, the Apple executives declined to give any specifics on iPhone 3G sales so far, other than to repeat that the company sold 1 million in the first three days. They did say that Apple expects to sell more iPhones than in any other quarter, meaning it will beat the 2.3 million phones sold in the last three months of 2007.   When pressed by analysts about why the iPhone is sold out in so many places, Mr. Cook suggested that there was no problem in Apple's production line.    \"The demand has been staggering in almost every country we have shipped in,\" he said. \"The manufacturing ramp is right on schedule.\" He said that the company was confident enough in its ability to increase production of the iPhone to increase distribution from 22 countries to more than 70 countries by the end of September.    \"I like what I'm seeing in the production ramp, and I'm confident in our ability to supply,\" he said. \"I am not going to predict when supply will equal demand.\"         ", "abstract": "Apple says it will have a new product in the coming months, as it warns investors that its profit margins will shrink because of lower prices.

Mozilla's Firefox, Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari all compete to give users the most control over their online identities and the best protection from Web sites that use \"cookies,\" those unique identifiers that can track users online.   So how effective are the newest batch of browser privacy tools? Kate McKinley, a researcher at iSec Partners, a San Francisco security firm, sought to find out.   In a paper published Tuesday, Ms. McKinley found particular problems with Safari and concluded that none of the four major browsers extend privacy protections to Adobe's immensely popular Flash plug-in, which is used to display Web animations and video.   Apple's Safari fared the worst of the browsers in Ms. McKinley's tests. When used in \"private browsing mode\" on a Macintosh running OS X, Safari was \"quirky,\" Ms. McKinley wrote, accessing some of the cookies previously stored on her computer, but not others. When used on a machine running Windows XP, Safari's private browsing mode was not private at all \u2013 it accessed previously set cookies and did not delete any new ones.   Of course, relatively few people use Apple's Safari on a PC running Microsoft Windows. The problem with Adobe's Flash software is a bigger issue, since 99 percent of Web surfers use the software, which drops its own separate cookies on people's computers.   Sites like MySpace, Hulu.com, CrateandBarrel.com and Amazon.com all use Flash cookies to record some kind of information about their users.   Ms. McKinley found that this information could not be deleted by average users in the browser privacy settings, should they wish to do so. \"Flash elevates the interest of developers over the interest of the end user,\" she said.  Emmy Huang, group product manager for the Adobe Flash Player, noted in an e-mail message that there is a separate process for deleting Flash cookies, which is described in this somewhat arcane document. She conceded that this may not be clear to most Internet users.  \"It is accurate to say that the privacy settings people make with regards to their browser activities are not immediately reflected in Flash Player,\" Ms. Huang wrote. \"Still, privacy choices people make for their browsers aren't more difficult to do in Flash Player, and deleting cookies recorded by Flash Player isn't a more difficult process than deleting browser cookies. However, it is a different process and people may not know it is available.\"  She added that Adobe is working with the browser makers on combining privacy settings for the browser and Flash to make it easier for users to manage their settings.

The start of the problems coincided with an announcement from an advocacy group which said that around 40 Olympic athletes had downloaded a pro-Tibet benefit album that was also carried on iTunes.  The IDG News Service reported Friday that the Amazon.com page for the \"Songs for Tibet\" album, which includes 20 songs from artists like Sting, Dave Matthews and Moby, could not be reached within China. Michael Wohl, executive director of the Art of Peace Foundation, which produced the album, cited comments on YouTube which said a video promoting the album might also be inaccessible in China.  Mr. Wohl said that while he had no proof, it appeared that the Chinese government had blocked iTunes and the Amazon and YouTube links using the \"Great Firewall of China,\" as the government's Internet control mechanisms are known. Expatriate iTunes users in China also concluded on Apple's customer service forums that the government was blocking the site.   There is no iTunes store aimed at the Chinese market, so those affected are mostly foreigners trying to reach versions of the store intended for the United States and Canada. A site that says it checks the availability of specific Internet addresses from China reported that both the YouTube and Amazon pages in question could not be accessed in either Shanghai or Beijing.    An Apple spokesman would not comment on the problem Thursday night. Chinese authorities either would not comment or had no information, The Associated Press reported.   The \"Songs for Tibet\" album was released exclusively on iTunes on Aug. 5, just before the opening of the Beijing Olympics. The Art of Peace Foundation, in conjunction with groups like the International Campaign for Tibet, also offered free downloads of the album to Olympic athletes through a special site unaffiliated with iTunes.   The International Campaign for Tibet then announced on Monday that over 40 Olympians had taken up the offer to download the album. Chinese users began reporting problems with iTunes that same day.  The Chinese authorities have tried to suppress protests in support of Tibet, which it views as a renegade province. They began criticizing the album even before Monday's announcement. A government-run Web site, China.org.cn, reported on Aug. 8 that \"Songs for Tibet\" had \"ignited strong indignation\" in the country.   The site also said some Chinese citizens were planning to boycott Apple products, including the iPhone, and wanted to ban the artists featured on the album from entering the country.  Mr. Wohl said the article incorrectly said the album advocated Tibetan independence.  \"We're only asking for freedom of expression in Tibet,\" he said. \"We're trying to celebrate a culture. The only way you could have a problem with that is if you're trying to eradicate that culture.\"  Either way, the controversy could hurt Apple's efforts to expand in China. The company recently opened its first store in Beijing, but does not yet have an agreement with a wireless carrier to sell the iPhone in China.  David Wolf, a consultant based in Beijing, wrote in his blog that Apple was using a \"bi-polar approach\" by featuring \"Songs for Tibet.\"   \"Apple -- and its shareholders -- must recognize that its own actions are sabotaging its efforts to build a market in China right as those efforts are showing fruit,\" Mr. Wolf wrote.  But Apple was far from the only retailer carrying the album. Scores of others, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, were selling it, Mr. Wohl noted.    While the effect this issue might have on Apple is unknown, Mr. Wohl sees a lot of upside for his group and other backers of Tibet.  \"The more they continue to block this,\" he said, \"the more we're raising awareness of what's going on over there.\" ", "abstract": "Internet users in China have been unable to access Apple\u2019s iTunes Store this week, after a pro-Tibet group announced that around 40 Olympic athletes had downloaded a benefit album.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Apple iTunes Store Is Blocked in China, Internet Users Say", "kicker": "Bits", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Apple iTunes Store Is Blocked in China, Internet Users Say", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-08-22T22:48:50+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/b94e2c01-b317-5cc3-b000-de89e65bc394", "word_count": 632, "uri": "nyt://article/b94e2c01-b317-5cc3-b000-de89e65bc394"}, {"web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/nbc-bypasses-apple-to-stream-tv-shows-to-the-iphone/", "snippet": "NBC is experimenting with offering its TV shows free to iPhone users using streaming technology.

(David. W. Dunlap/The New York Times))   Talk about brief. The Victoria's Secret store at Broadway and West 67th Street is turning out to have been one of the shortest-lived structures in a city that is legendary for building up and tearing down with complete abandon. Wrecking day has arrived.  Less than a decade after it was constructed, the store -- now tenantless -- is about to undergo an alteration that will leave only half of its exterior walls remaining, according to a Department of Buildings permit posted at the site. The transformation is significant enough that it is being handled by a demolition contractor.  What's to come?  Here's a tantalizing hint: the applicant on the Aug. 8 alteration permit is the architectural firm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. Among their clients is Apple Inc., for whom they have designed Apple stores in Midtown, SoHo, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo, among other places.  The replacement for Victoria's Secret has been less than a secret for quite some time. Lois Weiss of The New York Post called it nine months ago, and the retail blog Racked backed up her account.  Apple, however, is notoriously secret about its plans.  \"I don't have any information about that location,\" was all that Steve Dowling of Apple's corporate public relations office would say.  Gary Brandt, whose family owns the property, said, \"I'm not at liberty to discuss who the future tenant is at that site.\"  And a telephone message for the marketing director of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson has gone unreturned.  All of which means we will either be standing corrected in a few months. Or standing in line.

Microsoft is now creating a method for almost anyone to write and sell games for its Xbox 360 machines.", "lead_paragraph": "The open season on openness has reached that most closed of societies: the video game console. Microsoft is now creating a method for almost anyone to write and sell games for its Xbox 360 machines.   The new Microsoft plan for game developers is called Xbox Live Community Games. Here's the deal: Spend $99 to become a premium member in the XNA Creators Club. Write a game. Submit it to a panel of other club members for approval. If it is deemed \"safe to play\" you can set a price at between $2.50 and $10. Microsoft will sell the game and keep 30 percent.   Sounds like Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch, doesn't it? And Microsoft addresses that head on its detailed list of frequently asked questions about the program. Apple, Microsoft points out, approves all applications for the iPhone, while it uses the much more scalable method of having peers review applications.    We're revolutionizing the way games are created and distributed because we're not the arbiters of content. The games on Xbox LIVE Community Games will be built by the community, for the community and managed by the community.    Until now, developers needed to negotiate a business arrangement with Microsoft to have their games distributed for the Xbox.   The first crop of games written this way will appear in the fall. Only then will we see how much people who are used to the heavily produced console games, and the professional casual games on Xbox Live, actually want to play games written by amateurs. But if you asked how many people want to watch grainy amateur videos instead of professional television, you might well have missed out on the YouTube phenomenon.   Opening up game consoles could actually be very important in revolutionizing all of home entertainment. Remember that Xbox 360, Tivo and Apple TV boxes are fundamentally similar devices optimized for different purposes. All of them take information from a hard drive and an Internet connection to display entertainment on a television screen. Yes, the Xbox has much better graphics processing and an optical drive. The Tivo decodes cable and broadcast signals.   But the platforms are converging. Xbox does a brisk business in downloaded movies and has a new deal with Netflix. Tivo downloads movies from Amazon and now links to YouTube.   So think about this: a version of Apple's app store for Apple TV. This could serve as a basic game platform for Apple--not so basic if the company beefs up the graphic chip in the device. Moreover, apps for Apple TV could offer the sort of info snacking that iPhone apps do: weather, yellow pages, photo sharing, viral videos and so on. I assume video, photos and entertainment apps would be most popular, but there is someone who will do anything. And that's the beauty of an open environment.   But even more than casual entertainment, the right approach for open applications for an Internet connected video device will revolutionize television. Imagine a CNN application that lets you assemble a newscast on topics that interest you. People have been chatting about \"interactive television\" for several decades. But suddenly we have the right platform: A real computer with a broadband Internet connection coming in and video going out.    What's missing is how people will control this device. A traditional remote, with the up-down-left-right-select buttons, just isn't going to cut it. An open environment with thousands of choices in my view requires a keyboard because search turns out to be the very best way for people to find what they want fast. I've often thought that the best remote control will have a Blackberry style keyboard on it. But I have a new bet: Apple could let you use your iPhone or iPod Touch to control this new more powerful version of Apple TV. They already have a rudimentary remote application for playing music.   If you've read this far, you may think I've gone off the deep end. But I think we have seen the power of open and flexible computing environments over closed and specialized systems. You can see the revolution brewing in mobile phones. And I simply can't imagine why you would choose a closed system for the TV in your living room if you have a choice of an open one if it say as easy as an iPhone to use.    Microsoft clearly is making part of this bet with its community games initiative. Since Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in its attempt to build a closed set top box environment for pay TV companies, I don't know how much it will push the revolution to video. For now, Microsoft's game community doesn't allow for free apps sponsored by advertising, a necessary part of this vision.

After 25 years, Steve Jobs and Apple are pulling out of the Macworld Expo.  What a weird, crazy announcement! Wouldn't you expect the company that makes Macs to have a presence at a trade show called, you know, Macworld Expo?  But it's true. In a few weeks, it won't be Steve Jobs taking the stage to unveil Apple's latest goodies at Macworld, as he has every year since 1997; it will be marketing director Phil Schiller. And starting in 2010, Apple won't be there at all.  On the face of it, this is a shocker. Mr. Jobs's opening keynote presentations at Macworld are legendary. They were a symbol of his marketing genius (not to mention a model of effective PowerPoint). So many iconic products were unveiled at these keynotes: the iMac, the iBook, the iPhone, and so on. Heck, Steve Jobs's first public appearance when he returned to Apple in 1997 was at one of these keynotes. Isn't the Macworld Expo a cornerstone of Apple's marketing and media-hype strategy?  Everyone's first thought, of course, is that Steve Jobs's health is at stake. I'm not sure.  Mr. Jobs been pulling out of trade shows for years, long before his health was an issue. Apple quit attending the Macworld Expos in New York, Paris, Tokyo and so on. At the same time, as my CNBC colleague Jim Goldman points out, Apple has ramped up its periodic \"special events,\" whose schedule and structure it can control completely. That's how Apple unveiled its iPod, for example, and every new iPod generation.  The Macworld Expo organizers say that that show will go on. But it remains to be seen how much of a show they'll have without Steve Jobs, the big Apple announcements, and all the attendant media/public attention. (For example, the East Coast version of Macworld show tottered on for only two years after Apple pulled out.)  So no, it's not the end of the world. But it's still the end of an era, the end of a tradition, and therefore kind of sad. The death of the Jobs keynote will leave a hole in the technosphere. There's never been a show quite like it.

Wei-han Lien, the senior manager of Apple's chip team, dished out the morsel on LinkedIn, saying he's busy at work crafting an ARM processor for the next-generation iPhone.   (Photo: )   While it's a minor revelation, Lien's statement would confirm what many have expected ever since Apple acquired chip start-up PA Semiconductor in April for close to $300 million.   PA Semi had assembled an all-star cast of chip engineers, including Lien, and Apple confirmed that it bought the company for that talent. In a June interview with The Times' John Markoff, Apple's chief executive, Steve Jobs, went one step further, saying the PA Semi team would work on designing brand-new processors for future iPhones and iPods. The only question was which kind of processors.   The current iPhone includes ARM processors, which are very common in the mobile device industry. ARM Holdings is a British firm that licenses out its processor designs to other companies, who tweak the chips to suit their needs. While Apple refuses to confirm it, the company uses ARM processors made by Samsung in the iPhone, according to numerous analysts.   By developing its own ARM variant, Apple could create a processor that meets the specific needs of the iPhone and iPod, building support for functions like the touch screen or scroll wheel into silicon and possibly savings on costs by reducing the number of processors needed in each device. In addition, Apple will be able to maintain tighter controls on who knows what about its future products by disposing of an outside chip supplier.  \"They could put software accelerators on there or maybe do something like a graphics engine,\" said Fred Weber, the former chief technology officer of Advanced Micro Devices and current chief executive of the memory specialist, Metaram.  Such a move, however, comes with challenges.   \"You are taking on that internal risk of making sure this design goes well,\" said a chip analyst, Linley Gwennap, of the Linley Group. \"Even with a good team, there's always a risk that things will be late and delay the release of something like a new iPhone. By outsourcing that part, you have the opportunity of going to another company if the first cannot deliver what you need.\"  The construction of a bespoke mobile chip sees Apple returning to its historical roots. For years, Apple relied on more specialized processors from I.B.M. and Motorola rather than using the more common Intel processors adopted by the major computer makers. It eventually abandoned that strategy in 2005 and moved over to Intel chips, leaving Apple's software as the only major difference between its machines and rivals'.   The engineers at PA Semi specialized in crafting processors with strong performance and very low power consumption. Before shifting to Intel chips, Apple flirted with the idea of placing the PA Semi processors, which were similar in architecture to the I.B.M. and Motorola chips, into its laptops and desktops. PA Semi officials were, in fact, shocked when they learned in the press of Apple's decision to go with Intel. Apple's choice crippled PA Semi's business overnight and forced it to go after new markets like networking and storage gear.   While hunting for new customers, PA Semi also managed to attract the attention of military equipment suppliers who were intrigued by the low-power qualities of PA Semi's chips. (They consume less than 20 watts apiece.)   People familiar with the Defense Department's intentions say that PA Semi chips are set to go into missiles, computers in fighter jets and surveillance equipment.  \"By all accounts, the PA Semi chip is meritorious,\" said Will Strauss, an analyst with Forward Concepts. \"There really was nothing else quite like it.\"  When Apple bought PA Semi, it had no intention of morphing into a military supplier. The Defense Department, however, received push-back from suppliers who had already committed to long-term designs based on the microprocessor. These equipment makers urged the Pentagon to pressure Apple into continuing to supply PA Semi's chips for several years, according to people familiar with the negotiations, who declined to comment on the record because of Pentagon restrictions. Apple eventually caved.   \"We are extremely confident and pleased with the direction of PA Semi's silicon availability,\" said Bret Farnum, a vice president at Extreme Engineering Solutions, which makes specialized computing systems, some of which go to military suppliers. \"We have many customers that are going to continue to deploy it for the next four to five years.\"  Apple declined to comment on matters related to PA Semi, which it operates as a subsidiary.   It's unclear how many of the PA Semi processors will make their way into military systems. Some people I interviewed suggested that Apple could well sell enough of the chips over the next five years to cover the cost of the PA Semi acquisition. Others, however, said that the intense military interest in the processor that arose following the announcement of the acquisition came as a shock, since they were previously unaware of any military deals significant enough to keep PA Semi, which was running out of money, afloat.   \"If there was that much business sitting there when Apple tried to buy them, they would have turned down the offer,\" said Mr. Gwenapp. ", "abstract": "Apple's future iPhones and iPods may get a little extra zip from ARM processors designed by engineers at the company's PA Semiconductor acquisition, which also makes chips for the U.S. military.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "New iPhone Chip Will Cost an ARM and a Missile", "kicker": "Bits", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "New iPhone Chip Will Cost an ARM and a Missile", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-09-15T12:20:36+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/e988168c-1b8b-5589-9be6-2649c3ad1f32", "word_count": 892, "uri": "nyt://article/e988168c-1b8b-5589-9be6-2649c3ad1f32"}, {"web_url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/video-podcasts-the-sleeping-giant-on-appletv/", "snippet": "A footnote to Apple\u2019s presentation\u2013the ability of the AppleTV to play video podcasts\u2013may be the most important announcement because it opens a path for free, ad-supported programs from many sources to get onto televisions.", "lead_paragraph": "While Steve Jobs talked for a long time Tuesday at Macworld Expo about the movie rental feature of iTunes and Apple TV, he spent only a short time demonstrating its capabilities for podcasts.

The window into how Apple thinks about its stand-alone music player business is whether it cuts prices.", "lead_paragraph": "Expect a lot of socks at Apple's event Tuesday. IPod Socks are the sort of brand building fluff that Apple talks about when it isn't changing the fate of humanity.  A lot of people are guessing what Apple's \"Let's Rock\" presentation in San Francisco will be. That's the usual pre-show game. Of course, most of the guesses are about the sort of thing that would go unnoticed when any other company makes them: a slightly different shape for the iPod, \"trippy\" new graphics for iTunes, and no doubt all sorts of other little tweaks to its iPod lineup. (There isn't much noise that Steve Jobs will have much to say about the Mac line Tuesday, but he's been known to surprise.)   One key thing to watch are the price points. Apple's normal modus operandi is to slowly increase the value and features of its product line, but to keep the prices steady.  The base model of what is now called the iPod Classic was $299 from 2002 to 2005, and it has been $249 ever since. In that time, the storage capacity increased from 5 gigabytes to 80 gigabytes.   Similarly, the Nano was introduced in 2005 with a 2 gigabyte model that cost $199. The next year, Apple introduced a 1-gigabyte version for $149, and the base price for the Nano has stayed at $149 ever since, although the capacity is now 4 gigabytes.   Since the sales of stand-alone music players are slowing down, the question facing Apple is whether to keep the $149 price point for flash-memory players and the $249 price for hard-drive players. Right now, Amazon is selling SanDisk flash players with 4 gigabytes for $84 and with 8 gigabytes for $120. Microsoft's new line of Zune flash players offers a 4-gigabyte model at $129 and an 8-gigabyte model for $149.   It wouldn't be surprising to see similar price cuts from Apple in an effort to keep volume up. Instead, Apple could try to add features to maintain the existing price points. Microsoft adds a Wi-Fi connection and an FM radio to its Zune models, generally at the same price points that Apple uses. To my mind, Wi-Fi sync is a rather handy feature and it's the only thing that Microsoft has added to the music player world that I wish Apple would copy.   The other interesting iPod question is what Apple does to keep the high end attractive. It has been pushing the iPod Touch -- essentially an iPhone without the phone, G.P.S. chip, speaker and camera -- which starts at $299.   This is a far less mature product line, and there is a lot more room for innovation. There are lots of other potential features -- both in hardware and software Apple could add. A camera is one obvious thought, for example. A G.P.S. chip is another. Another possibility is a version of the Touch with a hard drive, merging the two higher end lines of iPods.   But here too, don't get dazzled by features. Anything is possible with enough money. The big question is the price point: Does Apple have the confidence in its innovation to make people pay $299 this Christmas for its very best media player line? Or does the slow economy, combined with greater competition from subsidized cellphones, mean it has to offer even more for less money to keep the socks on its iPod franchise?

That has touched off a wave of speculation that this update will fix the new handset's communications problems. But will it?  So far, Apple is not giving out any meaningful details about what the bug fixes might be. An Apple spokeswoman said that she would check to see if the company could say more.  If Apple won't be more forthcoming, perhaps iPhone users can help solve the mystery. What changed after you applied the patch?  My own experience is that since updating the handset in a downtown San Francisco high-rise about 15 minutes ago, the handset has on its own shifted back and forth between the older EDGE network and the new 3G network several times. I'm not sure why that's occurring or what impact it has on reliability.  Silicon Valley engineers have said that there have been international reports of teething problems with the radio chip from Infineon, the German chip maker, which Apple selected as the supplier for the iPhone 3G. Engineers have also said that whatever the problems are, they can be fixed with a software patch and will not require Apple to recall any of the more than a million iPhones it has sold since introducing the new version of the phone in July.   Apple has already circulated several versions of another more substantial fix, version 2.1, to its outside software developers, and apparently plans to release it to consumers next month. That patch caused a stir among its programmers this last weekend when the company removed a feature that was intended to allow applications to be awakened remotely.The iPhone will not allow third-party applications to run in the background -- supposedly for power efficiency and security reasons. But in the future, it will be possible to alert an application like an instant message program or a news program to connect to the wireless network and receive information. Apple said that feature was being taken out for more testing. ", "abstract": "Several hours ago, Apple shipped its second software update for the new iPhone 3G.

(Photo: (Credit: Jason DeCrow/Associated Press)) The company announced on Wednesday that it would start selling iPhones through Best Buy stores, complementing the Apple and AT&#38;T stores that already sell the phone. Colin A. McGranahan, the retail analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &#38; Co., said in a research note that Best Buy may well make no profit on the phone itself, and even if it does, its markup will amount to $50 or less.   Mr. McGranahan says this is nonetheless a good deal for Best Buy because it will be able to sell $50 to $100 in very high-margin accessories with each phone. Moreover, it can attract customers to its stores with a semi-exclusive arrangement.   Mr. McGranahan said Best Buy wouldn't give him any information on its deal, so this is all inference based on his understanding of the economics. (When I called Best Buy, a spokesman wouldn't comment on its arrangement with Apple and AT&#38;T.)   Here's how Mr. McGranahan works through his numbers, relying in part on information from other Bernstein analysts. The wholesale price of the base model iPhone, according to Bernstein's estimates, is $550. When AT&#38;T sells the phone for $199, it plans to make up the $350 subsidy from the monthly voice and data fees. When Apple sells that model, Bernstein estimates, it receives a $450 subsidy from AT&#38;T.    For Best Buy, however, the deal would not be as good, Mr. McGranahan figured. If it paid a $550 wholesale price for an iPhone that it then sells for $199, it may only receive $350 to $400 back from AT&#38;T, leaving it with a $0 to $50 profit. On another smartphone with a price to consumers of $199, Mr. McGranahan estimated the profit could easily be $100 to $200.   \"The margins on cellphones are normally pretty healthy for retailers,\" he told me. \"But Apple controls the iPhone and it is a phone that people want to buy.\"    Apple doesn't need Best Buy so much, he said, because it has widespread distribution through the roughly 2,000 AT&#38;T stores and another 200 Apple stores.   Then again, Best Buy does have some leverage too, he pointed out. It now controls Carphone Warehouse, one of the European distributors of the iPhone. And it is a major retailer of Apple's iPod and Macintosh lines.    Still, Apple has never been especially generous with its retailers, Mr. McGranahan noted. IPods also have unusually low margins, perhaps 10 percent, Mr. McGranahan said, but again there is a lucrative accessory business. Most personal computers have margins in the 8 percent to 10 percent range, he added. Macs may be better for Best Buy than others because their selling price is higher.   With such low margins on iPhones, I asked Mr. McGranahan whether customers will find that when they go to a Best Buy to buy an iPhone they will be told of the wonders of a Samsung Instinct or some other, presumably more profitable model.   \"I don't think they are going to try to do the bait and switch,\" he said, noting that Best Buy does not pay its sales force a commission. \"And even if they were, the customer that comes in asking for an iPhone doesn't want the Treo or the Instinct, they want the iPhone. So it's an incremental sale for them.\"   So long as that remains true, Apple will be able to cut very special deals indeed.

David A. Paterson of New York wants to impose a 4 percent state sales tax on online downloads of music and other media.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: A 4 percent sales tax would apply to digital downloads to devices like Apple's iPod under a proposal by Gov. David A. Paterson. (Photo: Robert Galbraith/Reuters))    First Amazon, now Apple?   In April, the State Legislature approved a measure that requires out-of-state online retailers to collect state sales tax and remit it to New York State, a move projected to raise about $50 million a year from retailers like Amazon.   Now, Gov. David A. Paterson wants to impose a 4 percent sales tax on online downloads of music, ring tones, games, movies and other media from online retailers like Apple (which already has a sizable presence in New York State, unlike Amazon), as well as pay-per-view movies sold by cable television providers. The proposal would increase revenue, state officials say, by $15 million in the fiscal year that starts in April and $20 million each following fiscal year.   The two tax-collection efforts -- the first has been commonly called the \"Amazon tax,\" and the second the \"iTunes tax\" -- raise related but distinct legal and policy issues. The nitty-gritty details follow.  The 'Amazon Tax'  Already, New Yorkers are bound to pay sales tax on the purchases of items that they use in the state -- regardless of where the purchases are made.   Indeed, Line 59, introduced on state personal income tax forms in 2003, requires residents to list the amount of unpaid sales tax that they owe on purchases from out-of-state retailers. As The Times reported in April, only 5 percent of the approximately 9.6 million residents who filed state income tax returns for 2006 listed anything owed on Line 59, according to the Department of Taxation and Finance.  So, as The Times reported in May, the issue is not whether people should pay tax when they buy goods from out-of-state sellers.   The question is whether the vendors must collect that tax on behalf of the state. Generally, only those companies that have a physical presence \u2014 like an office or store \u2014 in the state where the purchase is made are required to collect the tax.  The new law is based on a novel definition of what constitutes a presence in the state: It includes any Web site based in the state that earns a referral fee for sending customers to an online retailer. Amazon has hundreds of thousands of affiliates \u2014 from big publishers to tiny blogs \u2014 that feature links to its products. The state law says that thousands of those have given an address in New York State, although the addresses have not been verified.  The law says that if even one of those affiliates is in New York State, Amazon must collect sales tax on everything sold in the state, even if it is not sold through the affiliate. This is an extension of an existing rule that companies employing independent agents or representatives to solicit business must collect taxes for the state.  Amazon's suit challenges the constitutionality of this interpretation and seeks a declaratory judgment that it is invalid.   That litigation is pending.  The 'iTunes Tax'  Gov. David A. Paterson's budget proposal, which would take effect starting in June, defines the rationale for the proposed 4 percent tax on downloads as follows:   Because the sales tax is generally imposed on tangible personal property, and on a limited number of services delivered in tangible form or as services to tangible personal property or real property, these products are not subject to sales tax. This causes tax treatment that varies not according to the nature of a product but according to the product's form or the method of its delivery, and also erodes the sales tax base as intangible digital products escape taxation. Prewritten computer software is generally taxable, because it is defined in existing law as tangible personal property regardless of the form in which it is delivered. But while existing law provides rules on how to source tangible as well as digitally delivered prewritten computer software, even those rules need some clarification. Moreover, the Tax Department needs additional administrative mechanisms to foster better voluntary compliance in this complex area.  The new tax would apply to \"digital products\" -- including \"MP3 music files, ring tones, movies, digital books, digital photographs, downloaded and online games, and other entertainment services\" -- that are delivered \"via wire, cable, fiber-optic, laser, microwave, radio wave, satellite, or similar or successor media, or any combination thereof.\"   The new sales tax would not apply to custom computer software, telecommunications services, digital storage, cable or satellite television programming, or satellite radio programming. But that tax would apply to \"pay-per-view or on-demand movies sold by a cable or satellite television provider for a separately stated charge.\"  The sales tax would increase the cost of a 99-cent song track bought through iTunes to about $1.04.   There is precedent for such an \"iTunes tax\" in other states. In October 2006, New Jersey expanded its 7 percent sales tax to include digital downloads. As CNET News reported that year, several other states also levy sales taxes on digital downloads, but most of them do not require that the tax be collected by the retailer at the point of sale.

(Photo: Apple)) In his 2008 Environmental Update, Steve Jobs, the C.E.O. of Apple, highlighted the company's new product environmental performance reports -- part of Apple's efforts to design more efficient and eco-friendly products.   \"We are constantly working to reduce the emissions associated with Apple's products,\" Mr. Jobs wrote. \"This means making them more efficient in size and energy consumption.\"   That was the thinking behind the new MacBook, released last month and described on the company's Web site as \"the greenest MacBook ever\" \u2014 and there are quite a few design upgrades, green and otherwise.   Worth noting at the outset: just as the Prius comes at a premium over non-hybrid vehicles, the new 13-inch MacBook costs more than comparable notebooks running Microsoft Windows. The MacBook model I tested was the pricier $1,600 model, with bigger hard disk and faster processor than the less pricy version, which retails for $1,300.   Gateway's $1,000 MC7803u notebook, by comparison, boasts a 16-inch widescreen display that's similar to the MacBook's in fit and finish, twice the video memory (512MB v. 256MB) for better game-time performance, a 320 GB hard disk, and more ports and expansion slots than any one person could ever use.     Still, there are standout performance and usability improvements in the new MacBook \u2014\u00a0from the lighter weight (4 lbs.) to the brighter, instant-on backlight LED screen and backlit keyboard. And while you wouldn't know by looking at it, the new trackpad surface is made of glass, and responds to a number of iPhone-like gestures for flicking back and forth through Web pages, or zooming in and out with a pinch of the fingertips.   I also thought the lack of a dedicated click button would be a deficit (the pad itself is clickable in the new model), but I took to the new press-to-click method in a matter of minutes.  But what about the new MacBook's green credentials?   Well, as green gadgets go, the machine performs well. It achieves both Energy Star 4.0 compliance, as well as a gold rating from the Green Electronics Council. (Of course, 103 other notebooks have received gold status, too.)  The new MacBook has received mostly positive reviews from green-gadget watchers elsewhere \u2014\u00a0albeit with caveats. \"Its new laptops are definitely better,\" Casey Harrell, Greenpeace International's toxic campaigner, told the technology news service Newsfactor, adding: \"But not all toxic pieces have been eliminated yet.\"   The toxic contents he's referring to are generally made of polyvinyl chlorides (PVCs) or brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which are noxious when burned \u2014 something that happens frequently, Newsfactor pointed out, in the polluted overseas recycling markets for discarded Western electronics.   Hank Green, founder and editor of EcoGeek.org, saw a different problem. \"Although the computer is very efficient and uses less toxic and more recyclable materials,\" Mr. Green said in an e-mail message, \"the one revolutionary aspect of the MacBook \u2014\u00a0its solid aluminum brick construction \u2014 is not green at all.\"  The Apple Web site touts that the body of the laptop is made of \"a single piece of solid, recyclable aluminum that replaces dozens of extraneous pieces once destined for landfill.\" That may be true, but writing at EcoGeek last month, Mr. Green highlighted unnecessary energy expenditures:  The new process slices the computer case out of a 2.5 lb. brick of highly processed aluminum. At the end of the process, there's a 0.5 lb. case. So, right off the bat, Apple is creating a block of metal with a huge amount of embodied energy (from the mine through the final milling process) and the vast majority of it is just going into the recycling bin to be re-melted and re-processed.  \"The one revolutionary change is a step backward,\" Mr. Green said.   Following is a breakdown of some of the green and not-so-green parts that go into the MacBook (and sometimes come out as recyclables).  ***  (Photo: ) Aluminum All-Around: A single slab of solid, recyclable aluminum \u2013 which Apple refers to as the \"unibody enclosure\" \u2014\u00a0defines the machine's external anatomy. The MacBook's lid and base are also aluminum, and together the three pieces comprise an easily separable chunk of metal when it comes time to recycle. As mentioned above, however, some reviewers have suggested that a lot of excess aluminum processing may be involved.   (Photo: ) Mercury/Arsenic-Free Glass Screen: While all LCD screens are glass, most manufacturers cover the front with protective plastic shields. The MacBook's LCD LED backlit screen is fronted with recyclable glass, and contains none of the mercury or arsenic contained in traditional CCFL (that is, cold cathode fluorescent lamp) displays. One advantage of backlit LED displays is they light to full brightness when turned on, yet consume 30 percent less energy than conventional CCFL LCDs.   (Photo: ) Brominated Flame Retardant and PVC-Free (Mostly): Apple eliminated \"brominated flame retardants\" -- or BFRs -- from the MacBook's circuit boards, and discontinued use of polyvinyl chlorides, or PVCs, in the unit's internal cables and connectors. Both materials have poor health and environmental reputations, and their elimination allows the company to claim that MacBook is -- internally speaking, anyway -- completely PVC-free. But because the external power cord and adapter contain PVCs, Apple is unable to claim PVC-free status for the whole consumer package. The company said it is working to achieve PVC-free status for its external parts.   (Photo: ) Less Packaging: Made from a minimum of 25 percent post-recyclable material, the MacBook's completely recyclable packaging is 41 percent smaller than the previous model's packaging \u2014 a reduction that's not only appreciable to the buyer, but also to the environment, since Apple says it can fit 25 percent more units into shipping containers, thereby reducing greenhouse gases by way of reduced shipping sizes and materials.   (Photo: ) Sensors and Energy Savings: An ambient light sensor automatically adjusts energy savings aspects like screen and keyboard brightness (the keyboard is backlit from below), and how brightly the throbbing sleep indicator glows when the unit is in suspend mode. When idle, Apple says the MacBook uses one quarter of the power of an ordinary 60-watt light bulb.

When Apple released the MacBook Air, someone viewed the sleek notebook as an opportunity to make fun of clunky, old Dell on YouTube with a parody ad. But what if Dell is about to have the last laugh in the ultralight laptop race?  (Photo: )  A recent dig through Dell's trademarks turned up a couple of curiosities \u2013 \"Adamo\" and \"Adamo by Dell.\"According to the documents, the trademarks cover computer hardware, including possibly desktops and laptops.   The whole \"Adamo by Dell\" bit sounds rather fancy for a company that lumps all of its computers under just a handful of brands. But, apparently, this computer isn't your regular Dell computer. It has its own Web site after all, which says the product is coming soon.   Throw Adamo and Dell into a search engine, and you get nothing. Well, make that almost nothing.   A luxury goods publication appears to have some early marketing collateral from Dell for Adamo. \"Rumor has it that Dell is coming out with a computer called Adamo that will rival the MacBook Air,\" Uptownlife.net writes.   But most telling of all might have been the reaction of Michael Tatelman, Dell's vice president in charge of consumer sales and marketing, to my question about whether or not Dell had an Air-like product in store. Mr. Tatelman's mouth gaped open and his eyes darted away from my face.   If looks could reveal product dimensions, then I'd guess that Dell's going even thinner and lighter than Apple.   After a couple of moments, Mr. Tatleman said, \"I think we need to get some iconic products out there, so people associate Dell's brand with other things.\" Namely, that's goodbye to clunky, and hello to sleek.   A Dell spokesman, Bob Kaufman, said the company would not comment on speculation.   It remains to be seen whether Dell and its manufacturing partners in Asia can come up with something that rivals the aesthetics of Apple's MacBook Air. It is pretty clear, though, that Dell could beat Apple on price.   \"One of the things they could do real differently from Apple would be cheap,\" said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies, an analyst firm. \"They could shave $400 off the MacBook Air price pretty easily.\"  ", "abstract": "Is Dell about to make an ultra-sleek laptop?

Babies are born every day that don\u2019t yet have iPods, the company says hopefully.", "lead_paragraph": "CORRECTED &#124; 9/12 1:00 PM  On Wednesday, Adam Sohn, the head of public relations for Microsoft's Zune division, told me: \"Babies are born every day without an iPod. We will get there.\"  That summarizes the challenge Zune faces from Apple -- and Microsoft's determination (at least for now) to meet it.  It's hard enough trying to make a product that is more attractive, innovative, easy to use and cool than Apple does. But now many iPods are replacements by people who already have substantial music collections in iTunes. For those people, the choice is between buying an iPod that will simply work with all their music or investing the time and effort to try to convert everything tracks purchased from iTunes into Zune's formats.  No wonder that after two years in the music player business, Zune only has a 2 percent market share.   When the Microsoft delegation arrived last year to unveil the second generation of players, Chris Stephenson, Zune's marketing head, said the company's low market share in its first year was because it had only offered a hard-drive model at the high end of the market. With the addition of less expensive flash players, starting at $149. Mr. Stephenson said the company hoped to vault to No. 2 in the market, leaping past SanDisk.  \"Fifteen percent [market share] would be great for us,\" he said.  SanDisk still sells four times more music players than Microsoft does.   On Wednesday, Mr. Sohn dismissed SanDisk because most of its sales were for players that cost less than $100. Microsoft would rather add more features and sell players at higher price points, he said.   When Mr. Sohn got to the demo, I didn't see anything in the third generation of Zunes that is going to shake up the market. Like Apple, it added capacity at its existing price points. It's got a little trick to let you identify songs you hear listening to the FM radio and buy them from Zune's music store.   Two years after introducing the only really groundbreaking feature on the Zune -- its WiFi access -- Microsoft finally will let users buy songs directly on the device using the WiFi. (Yes, Apple, which has had WiFi devices since the iPhone and iPod Touch, added wireless purchases last year.) And Microsoft has made a variety of tweaks to its PC software and to the social network it introduced last year.  I asked Mr. Sohn what the company's research showed for why people actually bought the Zune. All these small-bore features, including the vaunted social network, weren't on the list.   Some like the FM radio, he said. A geeky hard core likes the fact it can sync music with a computer over WiFi. And some video fans liked that the screen size of the hard-drive Zune was bigger than the iPod classic. He admitted that the new $229 starting price point for the iPod Touch, which has a larger screen yet, was going to cause some trouble in that corner of Zune's tiny market.   Speaking of the Touch and the iPhone, I asked Mr. Sohn why Microsoft wasn't adding more really innovative features. The evolution of music players into flexible handheld computers should play into Microsoft's strengths as a maker of broad platforms.  Microsoft, Mr. Sohn said, is sticking to its initial conception that Zune is product that is devoted to music primarily and video secondarily. Microsoft's entertainment and device unit, under the leadership of Robert Bach, tries to have much more focus and clarity than most other parts of the company. The Windows Mobile division, which Mr. Bach also oversees, makes software for smartphones, and one of these years will have an answer to the iPhone.  But even in music and video, it seems like Microsoft is missing the opportunity to make Zune a much more interesting platform. Most significantly, to my mind, is whether the devices can offer much more free content by the artful use of advertising. Unlike Apple, Microsoft has a big division devoted to advertising. The WiFi connections on all the Zune players would be ideal to stream ad-supported video and maybe music.  We're working on it, Mr. Sohn told me. But last year J Allard, a top strategist for Mr. Bach, described an elaborate vision for Microsoft to be in the center of all media, none of which has come to fruition so far. Meanwhile, Apple continues to weave its way deeper and deeper into the music, video and now telephone business. And it has a shot at defining the next platform for handheld computing as well.  No wonder that Mr. Sohn is looking to this year's crop of newborns as the real target market for Zune. CORRECTION As a commenter, and Matt Rosoff on Cnet's Digital Noise blog point out, the Zune software does a nice job of indexing and playing the unprotected songs that iTunes has ripped in the AAC format. Zune can't read the protected format used by Apple for paid downloads (except from some labels that now allow Apple to sell unprotected AAC files). Yes you can convert those files too, by burning them to a CD and reimporting them, but that's a hassle. Protected video can't be converted.  So while some people may think there is a barrier to their switching from an iPod to a Zune, the real limit is far less than I initially wrote, except for people who have purchased a lot of music from Apple.

It's a thing of beauty, clad in aluminum like its more expensive Pro siblings. It's slightly lighter than the previous black or white plastic models (and, at $1,300, more expensive), but feels sturdier and more sculpted, thanks to the tapered edges.  (Photo: )   There are many changes to love--and one that makes me sad.  In the first category: a new, bigger, multitouch trackpad. With a flick of two, three or even four fingers, you can rotate a photo, scroll a document, zoom in or out, hide all windows, or flick into a different program.  There's no dedicated clicker button; instead, the entire trackpad is a clicker. It audibly, palpably clicks when you press down anywhere on it. You can even designate one corner of the trackpad to be a \"right-click\" spot for summoning shortcut menus.  You no longer need a coin to swap the battery; a finger latch does the trick. You also can swap out the hard drive just like a battery now. And there's a faster graphics card, which primarily benefits 3-D gamers.   There's good news on the environmental front too. There's no longer any mercury, bromine or chlorine in this machine; no arsenic is used in manufacturing to smooth out the glossy glass of the screen; and the MacBook comes in a very small box, meaning that fewer trucks and ships are needed for transport from the factory.   The MacBook has enough storage and power that it could be your main machine. In fact, that's the idea behind Apple's new 24-inch monitor that was revealed alongside the MacBook; it's for laptops only. A three-headed cable from the screen connects to a Mac laptop's magnetic power-cord jack, USB jack and video output.  OK. And now the sad news: the MacBook doesn't have a FireWire jack.  Now, Apple has a long tradition of inventing, championing and then abandoning certain hardware features. Over the years, Apple has eliminated the SCSI port for hard drives, the ADB jack for mouse or keyboard, the floppy drive, the dial-up modem, and so on. There's always a brief period of wailing from affronted Mac fans, and then life goes on.  With the disappearance of FireWire, there's once again a lot of wailing online. And this time, I'm among them.  FireWire is fantastic for three reasons. First, it lets you easily hook up an external hard drive--no restarting, no separate power cord required. \"But USB hard drives work the same way,\" Apple points out. OK, fine. That means throwing away your investment in FireWire hard drives and sacrificing a little speed. But you'll survive.   Second, FireWire offers a feature called Target Disk Mode. That's where you connect two Macs with a FireWire cable, turning Mac #2 into a glorified external hard drive for Mac #1. Now you can transfer huge files extremely quickly.  Apple says, \"You can do the same thing with an Ethernet cable,\" and that's true. But Target Disk Mode also lets you repair or recover Mac #2 if it won't start up, and there's no replacement for that tactic.  Third, FireWire is how you connect tape camcorders to the Mac. This is the part that kills me.  I'm big into home movies. I've got 100 MiniDV tapes carefully stored--of my children growing up, of my TV appearances, of our trips and memorable moments. The video quality is amazing. And because they're digital, I sleep easy, knowing that I can make fresh copies of those tapes at any time, without any quality loss. For 15 years, I've intended, someday, to edit those tapes down into a series of cherished DVDs. Maybe when the kids get married.   But not if FireWire goes away. If that happens, my tapes will be stranded and uneditable.   Apple's defense is, \"Hey--we're just the messenger.\"   The company points out--accurately, alas--that nobody's buying tape camcorders anymore; people either buy memory-card or hard-drive camcorders, or they just record video on their digital still cameras. All of which connect to a computer by USB.  OK, fine. But my question to all those people abandoning tape is: what then?   When a tapeless camcorder fills up, you have to empty it out onto a computer, right now, or you're done shooting. And then what? What hard drive has ever lasted you more than about five years? How will your grandchildren be able to enjoy the videos you take today? What storage format will last that long?  Burn your videos to DVD? Yeah, sure--home-burned video DVDs are essentially non-editable, the quality isn't as good as the original, and they have questionable longevity. (Just this week, I inserted a DVD containing some of my Times Web videos from 2005. On three out of my four computers, the disc was unreadable.)   No, the only real solution for home-movie storage is to buy a few gigantic hard drives. Then make it your new hobby to transfer videos from drive to drive through the decades, hoping that none of them ever dies along the way.  (Apple also points out that FireWire is still available on its desktop Macs and its larger, heavier, more expensive Pro laptops. And one older, plastic MacBook model is still for sale, at $1,000--with FireWire. But when Apple drops FireWire from its bestselling machine, it's a good bet that other models will follow.)  Last week, on the phone, I got a chance to vent my unhappiness to Steve Jobs himself. I told him about my long-held intention to edit down those 100 tapes, maybe when I'm retired.  I must admit, he gave me quite a wakeup call. He pointed out that in 10 years, there won't be any machines left that can play them.   (He also mentioned that, realistically, the only time people really edit their movies is just after they've shot them. And sure enough: I've been intending to edit my tapes for 15 years now; what makes me think I'll have time to do it in the next 15?)  Mac and video fans may not like it--especially the part about having to buy a new, tapeless camcorder--but the writing is on the wall. Tape is dead; camcorder manufacturers have been saying as much for years now. And Apple is not about to preserve some legacy jack just for the sake of the dwindling MiniDV cult.  Deep down, I've known all along that the window for rescuing those old tapes would eventually close. In the end, all Apple has done with its FireWire phaseout is to set a date for it, or at least to start the countdown clock.  I love the new MacBook, I really do. Maybe I'll get one someday. But in the meantime, I've got a big project ahead of me. ", "abstract": "Apple\u2019s bestselling MacBook laptop just got its 2008 makeover.

(Photo: Tony Cenicola/The New York Times)) I'm so happy summer is over. I know, it's October, but pre-Global Warming harbingers of seasonal change, like the equinox, no longer interest me. Not when 80 degree days in New York can happen any time.  But I know summer's over because I can stand the heat in the kitchen again. I can leave the oven on for longer than five minutes. I can bake and roast, which is what I did because I had yams on the brain.  My son Peter asked me what the difference was between a sweet potato and a yam. That's one of those annoying trick questions that teenagers ask their fathers, like, \"Which pencil will hit the ground first, the one I drop straight down from the table or the one I push outward off the table?'' (HINT: they hit at the same time.) Or, \"Would you please explain the financial meltdown to me?\"   I will say that in this country at least, the terms sweet potato and yam are used interchangeably. But I prefer yam, as it reminds me of the yam-seller scene in Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man'' \u2013 \"I can see you a serious yam eater, young fellow.''   Anyhow, I popped the yams in the oven to bake for an hour. With them, I was going to prepare smoked pork chops with apples. As the yams were roasting, I sauteed the chops with nothing more than salt and pepper. Then, when they were done, I removed the chops and poured some local cider into the pan along with sliced apples. As the cider cooked down and the apples sweetened up, I took the yams out, slit the skins and mashed some butter into the orange pulp. Now what to drink?  There could be many possibilities here. A good Crozes-Hermitage or Saint-Joseph from the northern Rhone would go beautifully with the smoky pork chops, although the apples might be a bit sweet. A riesling would be wonderful, and a dry gew\u00fcrztraminer would be, too. And a light pinot noir or a lean chardonnay as well. How could I go wrong?  But I had something else in mind, a chenin blanc. Now, I've written before about this sadly overlooked grape and its wonderful wines.  (Aarghh! I would link to it but I find to my consternation that two years ago right here in The Pour I also paired a chenin blanc wine with smoked pork chops and yams. Yikes! I'm repeating myself. I can see my teen-age sons looking at each other and laughing. I can hear the doctor asking me if this happens often. I can imagine my wife patting my hand sympathetically. Oh, the brain of a middle-aged father of teen-agers is a terrible place to be stranded!)  But honestly, praise for chenin blanc can bear some repeating. It is a wonderfully versatile wine, beautiful dry, off-dry or deliciously sweet because, like riesling, it has a tremendous natural acidity that can balance sweetness. Chenin blanc is not as delicate as riesling, but it was a wonderful, full-bodied texture that I love. Even in the dry versions I often find a touch of honey that gives the wine depth.  The most famous chenin blancs come from the Loire region, from Sav\u00e8nnieres and Vouvray but some very good ones also come from Montlouis, just across the river from Vouvray.   After a Thanksgiving tasting in 2007, in which we had the wonderful 2005 Montlouis Clos du Breuil from Fran\u00e7ois Chidaine, I bought a few bottles, but I hadn't had one since then. So I decided on the Chidaine.  Good chenin blanc can age for years, and this is one of those bottles that will keep getting better. I was a little concerned that it might be in a non-expressive period, which can happen after the youthful exuberance fades. But this wine was singing, with lovely mineral and apple flavors that went well with the apple accents on the pork chops and yams. Naturally, I had poured the apple concoction over both, copiously.  I enjoyed this match so well that I plan on forgetting about it again and writing it up next year, too.

Our electronics make us more productive, entertain us and make us cool.  But if you had to judge by my e-mail inbox, you'd conclude that tech is the bane of our existence. It's a cavalcade of complaints.  Often, readers write to me about how they've been ripped off by this company or that, hoping that I'll take up their causes and bring them satisfaction. Well, I consider myself a consumer advocate, but there aren't enough days in the week for me to become everyone's free consultant. Usually, I write back with a quick note of sympathy, which sometimes makes the complainer extremely angry.  So this week: a massive complain-a-thon, a compilation of recent gripes in my inbox. May it suffice to shine the light on the companies my readers think are falling down on the job.  \"Please write an article shaming Jott for going to a subscription model. Jott was the best free thing since sliced bread. Now they want to charge us a monthly fee.\"  Jott is a great service where, when you want to leave yourself a reminder, you call an 800 number and speak it. They transcribe your utterance and e-mail it to you.   Jott was free in its beta-testing period. This week, they launched officially, charging $3 a month. There's still a free version, but it's very stripped-down; you have to check your transcriptions on the Web instead of getting them by e-mail.   Look, it's a business. It can charge what it wants. I happen to agree that the free version is too bare-bones--why not limit the number of Jotts per month, rather than the function?--but \"shame?\" Come on.   \"In March, I quit my job, borrowed $30k from family members, and put everything on the line to build a company around the iPhone platform. I now have a great product that's been ready for over a month, but hasn't seen the light of day. Apple didn't properly prepare for the flood. My user-friendly, functional application has languished while 22 tip calculators, 8 flashlights, and even 'I am Rich' made it to the store. And worse yet, there has been a complete lack of communication about any of it; procedures, contracts, status, time estimates, etc. The dream of creating great iPhone apps has turned into a personal nightmare. I've been losing sleep, feeling sick, gaining weight, and I just about had an emotional breakdown today.\"  Well.  It does seem like Apple bit off a bit more than it could chew, launching the App Store, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 2.0 software and MobileMe all on the same day. [Update: My correspondent's iPhone app is finally available on the store, but he's still livid.]  \"Yesterday, I noticed from my iTunes that Apple had recently released 2.0.1 for the iPhone. I downloaded the 240-megabyte update. A little while later, I received an unknown error 6 and the update aborted, but not until after it had erased my phone. So for the second time in the past couple of months, my phone became a brick. My impression is that Apple can't cope with the success of the iPhone and the demands it puts on their engineering and support organizations.\"  Mine, too.  \"I am a doctor, but not a good typist, and I have found that Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS) is indispensable in making entries into my Electronic Medical Record (EMR) program; DNS has saved me literally thousands of hours in the last few years in updating my patients' records. But I purchased a copy of DNS version 10 as soon as it was available--and tried to begin dictating into my EMR. DNS stopped dead. A dialog box appeared stating that the only version of Naturally Speaking 10 that would dictate into an EMR was the Medical version of Dragon, which costs 10 times the price! Very sad that Nuance has chosen to take the low road in dealing with its new and established customers.\"    Nuance replies: \"You are correct that we decided to remove EMR support from the non-Medical versions of Dragon. We found that some large hospitals were using the consumer editions of Dragon and not getting the accuracy, quality and manageability that would be achieved when using Dragon Medical. It is also a common practice in the software industry to create feature packages for several markets and sell them at different prices (e.g. Microsoft Office). That practice allows us to maintain a low consumer price for Dragon, while offering higher value solutions for our Medical customers.   \"Having said that, please note that along with the launch of Dragon Medical 10 in September, we will announce attractive upgrade offers for customers who have been using non-medical Dragon versions in medical settings.\"   \"Yesterday I took my second iPhone home after the first one wouldn't hold a charge. This one charged and worked fine, except for one thing. I noticed last night that it had Cube Runner and Facebook apps installed--something I know I did not download because I haven't downloaded ANY apps yet. I also found somebody else's bookmarks on this iPhone. At some point in the Apple chain, someone clearly made a decision to put a returned/used iPhone back in the box, seal it and try to pass it off as brand new.\"  Yikes.  \"As I'm sure you know, the new iPhone is plagued with connectivity issues. It's terrible! I live and work in midtown Manhattan, and I have trouble getting good reception. Also, even when there are full bars on the 3G icons, my emails don't download or send. I regularly have tons of e-mails stuck in outbox!! Apple discussion boards have a lot on this but of course, no word from Apple. $10 more per month for 3G service for this?\"  Yes, there's lots of discussion online about why some people in some cities are having connection problems with iPhones. I'm confident that fixing them is high on Apple's to-do list.  Which is apparently getting longer by the day.

The Pothole Law -- passed in 1979 to make it harder for people to sue -- protects the city from liability for injuries to people who trip or fall on sidewalks that are \"out of repair, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed,\" unless a written notice of the defect has been provided to the city's Department of Transportation at least 15 days before the accident. Previously, the injured person only had to show, usually through witnesses, that the crack or hole or protrusion had been there long enough for the city to be able to fix it.   In response, in 1982, the trial lawyers set up the Big Apple Pothole and Sidewalk Protection Committee, which hires workers to scour the city's nearly 10,000 miles of streets and document potholes and other defects.  The committee started to supply thousands of maps to the city, documenting hundreds of thousands of purported defects. \"The city initially refused to accept the maps as evidence of the required notice, but the lawyers sued -- what else? -- and won,\" Joseph P. Fried wrote in The Times in 1993.  The issue is important because the city pays tens of millions of dollars a year in personal-injury claims. Trial lawyers typically get a third or more of the judgments.   But now, the adequacy of the Big Apple maps is in question.   On Thursday, in a pair of cases, the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, ruled that the map was \"not sufficient notice\" under the Pothole Law.   The map uses coded symbols to represent defects. \"For example, a straight line is used for a raised or uneven portion of a sidewalk, a circle for a hole or hazardous depression, a line with a triangle at each end for an extended section of cracks and holes in a sidewalk, and so forth,\" Judge Robert S. Smith wrote in his opinion for the court's majority.  In one case, that of a man named Pasquale D'Onofrio, the place he fell was indicated on the map with a straight line. \"It is not completely clear how the accident happened, but there is no evidence that Mr. D'Onofrio walked across a raised or uneven portion of a sidewalk, even on the assumption that the grating is part of the sidewalk,\" Judge Smith wrote. \"A photograph of the area where he fell  does not show any surface irregularity or elevation.\"   A jury ruled in Mr. D'Onofrio's favor, but a lower court judge set aside the verdict. The Court of Appeals agreed.  The second case was brought by Ida Shaperonovitch, who tripped over an elevation on a sidewalk. But the map contained a symbol that was utterly unclear, Judge Smith wrote:   No unadorned straight line, the symbol for a raised portion of the sidewalk, appears on the Big Apple map at the relevant location. The Shaperonovitch plaintiffs rely on a symbol that does appear there: it is a line with a diamond at one end and a mark at the other that has been variously described as a poorly drawn X, the Hebrew letter shin, or a pitchfork without the handle. No symbol resembling this appears in the legend to the map. A Big Apple employee, called to testify by the City, acknowledged that Big Apple \"did not notify the City of any raise\" in the location where Ms. Shaperonovitch fell.   Judge Theodore T. Jones Jr., who is one of seven nominees for the position of chief judge that is being vacated by Judith S. Kaye, wrote in a dissenting opinion:     Mapping hazards is hardly an exact science. Although the symbols on the Big Apple maps were not designed to give notice of every unique defect found on the sidewalks and roads of New York City, each symbol on the map legend represents a general category of potentially hazardous defects (e.g., \"Hole or hazardous depression,\" \"Raised or uneven portion of sidewalk,\" \"Pothole or other hazard\").     Mr. D'Onofrio's injury, Judge Jones wrote, was caused by the \"movement of a loose metal grating\" along with some \"broken cement alongside the edge of that grating.\" The map's symbol, signifying a \"raised or uneven portion of sidewalk,\" was not so far off, the judge wrote: \"In my view, the gap created from the crumbling cement alongside the grating was an irregularity in elevation and could reasonably have been included under the category of \"uneven sidewalk\" -- it was at least a close call.\"  And in Ms. Shaperonovitch's case, Judge Jones wrote that the mark, however ambiguous, \"gives notice to the City of some defect -- rather than no defect at all -- at that location.\" He added, \"As to which specific defects were depicted, the symbols could be reasonably interpreted in

"(Photo: North African salads like this Moroccan beet salad are good with brisket. (Photo: Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times)) Joan Nathan answers more reader questions about Rosh Hashana and Jewish cooking.  Q. Do you have suggestions for side dishes that go well with brisket and can be cooked in advance? -- Allie  Joan replies: What I like to do is have one vegetable dish with sweet potatoes or carrots, like a tsimmes. In addition, I like to make a variety of North African salads that can be made ahead and are beautiful. You can look in any of my cookbooks for great recipes   Q. Do you have a recipe for cinnamon twists, the plain cake that is a big hit in my house for the holidays? -- Jean Kerner   Joan replies:  I don't think you mean cinnamon twists because you said plain. This cinnamon coffee cake from Country Club Restaurant and Pastry Diner in Philadelphia is one that I make for the holidays.  CINNAMON COFFEE CAKE  For cake: 2 sticks unsalted butter, plus some to grease pan 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus some for pan  2 cups sugar 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups sour cream For topping:  2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan. 2. To make the cake: cream together sugar and 2 sticks of butter. Add eggs and vanilla, beating well. 3. In separate bowl, sift together 4 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, then add to other ingredients, alternating with sour cream. Beat well until smooth. 4. To make topping: mix sugar, walnuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon. 5. Pour three alternating layers of batter and filling in pan, starting with batter and ending with filling. 6. Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted. Leave in pan about 15 minutes and then remove, inserting a knife around sides.  Yield: 12 servings  Q. I would like to make a tzimmes with chuck steak. Can any tsimmes recipe be adapted for a crockpot? How? \u2014 Debbie R.  Joan replies:  Since a tzimmes with meat takes a long time to cook you can use chuck steak and a crockpot. Good luck.   Q. Your cookbook on Holiday Cooking is a Jewish food bible for me. What apples do you recommend for Jewish Apple Cake? I take the cake for the Rosh Hashannah oneg at my synagogue. It's so moist and yummy, and everyone always wants the recipe. -- Jane  Joan replies:  Thanks for your thoughts. I used to use Granny Smith but now I prefer more flavorful apples that are not so tart, like Cortland or Gala. I think I'll make that recipe tonight!  Q.  I'm not Jewish and my husband is a secular Jew who never celebrated Rosh Hashana as a kid. Now that we have children we want to celebrate but I have no idea what a \"traditional\" Rosh Hashana meal would consist of and my husband doesn't either. Are there standard items that should be served and if so, what? Thank you. \u2014 Elizabeth  Joan replies: For Rosh Hashana you should start with apples dipped in a bowl of honey and round challah. I also like to add a new fruit of the season such as pomegranates or dates. In addition, for the meal before the holiday starts I always have chicken soup with matzo balls, roast chicken or honey roasted chicken (look in my various cookbooks and you'll get some ideas) with a carrot and pineapple tsimmes or casserole as well as a salad. For dessert I always make a blue plum tart. For Rosh Hashana after synagogue on Monday I make a gefilte fish mold, brisket, lots of North African salads and some apple cakes for dessert. Often I add a dish like the beet and Swiss chard dish in the Times on Wednesday to show the diversity of Jewish food. Ask your husband what his background is and go from there. Good luck!  Q. I am hosting a dairy Rosh Hashana lunch and would like every dish that I serve to include symbolic foods. Do you have any ideas? Thanks so much. -- Alexis  Joan replies: What a great idea. If you use symbolic dishes, then start with a round challah, have some kind of fish, leek patties, the Swiss chard dish without the meat, pomegranates, dates, and, of course, apple dipped in honey. These are some of the symbolic foods eaten by Sephardic Jews.   Q.  Can you recommend a vegan entree that I can bring to the Rosh Hashana table that will appeal to omnivores and vegetarians? -- Jasmine  Joan replies:  Use the Swiss chard dish without the meat. You could substitute tofu if you want. This will be a great hit!

First he helped introduce the New York version of Google Transit. Then he rollerbladed 20 blocks north and west to the unveiling of the new HTC G1 phone, the first that uses Google's Android phone software.   (Photo: Google's founders Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin introduced the G1 on Tuesday in New York. (Credit: Jacob Silberberg/Reuters)) Someone at Google must not have searched for what happens on the East Side of New York in late September -- the neighborhood was clogged as limousines shuttled dignitaries around for the opening of the United Nations session. Mr. Brin said he found that even on rollerblades, his path was blocked.   Blocking anything, however, was not on the agenda at the press event, held in a cavernous space under the 59th Street Bridge. Executives of Google, HTC and T-Mobile, the first carrier to introduce the phone, used the word \"open\" more often than a gaggle of pediatric dentists.   When I caught up with Mr. Brin after the news conference, he talked about how Google has worked to loosen the grip that the notoriously controlling cellphone industry has on their networks. \"I like to give ourselves a little bit of credit,\" Mr. Brin said. \"We tend to take what could be viewed as a radical position on openness. Over time, most of the carriers understand that giving their customers more choices will expand usage.\"   Without saying so, this talk of openness was meant to imply a contrast with Apple, which has the right to restrict what applications are allowed on the iPhone and exercises that power without any public explanation of its policies.   (It has now been 11 days since Natalie Kerris in Apple's PR office wrote me that she would look into a question about a podcasting application Apple banned from the iPhone. I have heard nothing back, despite several follow up e-mail messages.)   After speaking to Mr. Brin, I met with Cole Brodman, the chief development officer of T-Mobile, and asked him what limits T-Mobile would impose on applications.   The G1 is certainly not totally open. On some phones, like BlackBerries and Palm Treos, people simply can install applications right on the phone without asking anyone. For Android phones, all applications must be installed through an application store run by Google. Still, the process is simply meant to prevent malicious applications, he said.  \"Our ground rules are very simple,\" he said. \"The application developer has to verify they are who they are. They have to certify the application does what it does. And they have to inform the user what the application does.\"   What about a voice-over-Internet-Protocol application like Skype that would let a G1 user bypass T-Mobile's network? That's fine, he said.   \"The device is already sold with a voice and data plan, so you can connect through T-Mobile anywhere in the world,\" he explained. \"So we think we have already solved the hard part. If someone wants to write a voice-over-IP application that will allow additional ways to connect, that is something the platform will allow.\"   And what about some video application that might use a lot of wireless bandwidth? There Mr. Brodman offered an asterisk.   \"Today, we are not imposing bandwidth rules on the applications,\" he said. \"In the future, we will have to look at how to efficiently use network bandwidth.\" He suggested that the carrier may impose restrictions or ask for payments from applications that use a lot of bandwidth and also make money, like from advertising.   Later, I saw Broadband Reports write that the fine print of T-Mobile's new data plan for the Android phone allows the company to restrict usage for people who use more than 1 gigabyte of data each month.   I wrote to Mr. Brodman to clarify this, and I'll update this post when he writes back.   The answers to my questions about bandwidth, and even VOIP, show how Google is in a very different position to talk about openness than wireless carriers and so many other companies. As much as users want T-Mobile to permit them to do absolutely anything with their phones, the company has to consider the costs of its bandwidth, the potential loss of lucrative voice minutes and so on.   Right now, Google is not managing any details to make sure the Android initiative makes money. Indeed, Mr. Brin said that Android has no revenue associated with it whatsoever. The software is given free to HTC and other phone makers. And Google isn't even going to run the application store to make a profit.   Of course, since its search, maps, e-mail and other services are woven through the Android software, the company has ample places on which it can sell ads.   When I asked Mr. Brin how well the HTC G1 would do in the market against Apple's iPhone, he said he didn't care. The point of the effort was simply to get more people using the Internet on mobile devices on the assumption that Google will get its usual (and very high) share of search traffic.   \"The iPhone is a great phone,\" Mr. Brin said. \"The G1 is a great phone. The more highly capable phones that are out there, the happier we will be.\"   At that, I left Mr. Brin to lace up his rollerblades and skate off to Google's offices in Chelsea, far from the diplomats' limos.

Like the Zune, it's from a late-from-the-gate tech behemoth (Google in this case), and it is up against a well-ensconced, well-thought-out Apple product, the iPhone. By comparison, the G1 interface is somewhat clunky and a tad bug-ridden. With but a few Android apps available online (app shopping works best from the handset, although it's a laborious process), it has little to challenge the Apple App Store.   But the G1 does has some advantages. There's the aforementioned resilient case for one. A slider screen reveals a backlit qwerty keyboard in addition to the touch screen, for another.  There is one critical difference. The Google engineers are willing \u2013 in fact eager \u2013 to hear consumer criticism and respond. If you check the Android forum, you'll see that engineers are responding to consumer requests along the lines of \"Good point, thanks, we are working on that.\"  So if the G1 isn't everything you hoped for out of the box, it seems likely to get better.

ZDNet is reporting that it will spend $500 million to make a powerful statement to its hundreds of millions of customers. I imagine the statement would have to go something like this:   Windows Vista isn't really as bad as they say. Honest. Please don't be mad at us. We promise our next operating system will be better. Pinky swear.    Those aren't exactly the words they use, but it is certainly the tone of the ad that Microsoft has started running on its site. I can't find it, but Ed Bott at ZDNet did and has a copy here. It shows a painting of a tall ship with the headline \"At one point everyone thought the Earth was flat. Get the facts about Windows Vista.\"   That promotion leads to a page that acknowledges that Vista had problems:   But we know a few of you were disappointed by your early encounter. Printers didn't work. Games felt sluggish. You told us\u2014loudly at times\u2014that the latest Windows wasn't always living up to your high expectations for a Microsoft product.   It takes a minute to figure out where to find Microsoft's response to this criticism: You need to click some arrows on the page. (Why can't Microsoft use the plus Icon popularized by Google and lots of others?)   The company asserts that it is now compatible with the vast bulk of software and hardware. It also boasts that Vista is more secure, faster, uses less energy and is even \"sexier.\"   Sure, Windows Vista gets a lot of compliments on its aesthetics. But its style serves an important purpose: to put everything within a click's reach and make you more productive.   Microsoft, is probably right that Vista gets a bit of a bum rap. Lots of people find that Vista works fine and is an improvement over Windows XP. I use Vista on a home computer with little trouble. (And no, I don't hate Microsoft, despite what some commenters say. I am a big fan of Word 2007, and I even pay for Microsoft's OneCare anti-virus and backup software.)    But this is still a dreadful place for Microsoft to be. It is fighting Google on one side and Apple on the other. And both of those companies have flaws, products that don't quite work right, have gaps and disappoint users. But both Google and Apple have products that you don't need to be told to notice they are sexy. That changes how people see the more prosaic parts of their product lines and makes people far more open to considering new products.   Even if you are a big fan of Microsoft, consider which you would rather read about first: a something new from Google, Apple or Microsoft?  After spending $500 million, Microsoft might be able to convince people that Windows Vista is not awful. But just because you can show the earth is not flat, doesn't mean you will rule the new world.

ZDNet is reporting that it will spend $500 million to make a powerful statement to its hundreds of millions of customers. I imagine the statement would have to go something like this:   Windows Vista isn't really as bad as they say. Honest. Please don't be mad at us. We promise our next operating system will be better. Pinky swear.    Those aren't exactly the words they use, but it is certainly the tone of the ad that Microsoft has started running on its site. I can't find it, but Ed Bott at ZDNet did and has a copy here. It shows a painting of a tall ship with the headline \"At one point everyone thought the Earth was flat. Get the facts about Windows Vista.\"   That promotion leads to a page that acknowledges that Vista had problems:   But we know a few of you were disappointed by your early encounter. Printers didn't work. Games felt sluggish. You told us\u2014loudly at times\u2014that the latest Windows wasn't always living up to your high expectations for a Microsoft product.   It takes a minute to figure out where to find Microsoft's response to this criticism: You need to click some arrows on the page. (Why can't Microsoft use the plus Icon popularized by Google and lots of others?)   The company asserts that it is now compatible with the vast bulk of software and hardware. It also boasts that Vista is more secure, faster, uses less energy and is even \"sexier.\"   Sure, Windows Vista gets a lot of compliments on its aesthetics. But its style serves an important purpose: to put everything within a click's reach and make you more productive.   Microsoft, is probably right that Vista gets a bit of a bum rap. Lots of people find that Vista works fine and is an improvement over Windows XP. I use Vista on a home computer with little trouble. (And no, I don't hate Microsoft, despite what some commenters say. I am a big fan of Word 2007, and I even pay for Microsoft's OneCare anti-virus and backup software.)    But this is still a dreadful place for Microsoft to be. It is fighting Google on one side and Apple on the other. And both of those companies have flaws, products that don't quite work right, have gaps and disappoint users. But both Google and Apple have products that you don't need to be told to notice they are sexy. That changes how people see the more prosaic parts of their product lines and makes people far more open to considering new products.   Even if you are a big fan of Microsoft, consider which you would rather read about first: a something new from Google, Apple or Microsoft?  After spending $500 million, Microsoft might be able to convince people that Windows Vista is not awful. But just because you can show the earth is not flat, doesn't mean you will rule the new world.

A computer requires an operating system such as Windows, Apple's OS X or Linux to make the machine work. It does, however, have the potential to do what Mr. Gates feared: make the choice of operating system less important.\"  So writes John Gapper, the fine columnist for The Financial Times in today's paper. Chrome, of course, is Google's new browser, which is pretty explicitly designed to be a Windows killer. As Mr. Gapper notes, that precise fear -- that an Internet browser could become such a powerful platform for applications software that it would effectively take over the function of the operating system -- is what caused Microsoft to start the browser wars in the 1990s, effectively putting Netscape out of business.  But it seems to me that even without the browser-as-platform, Windows is already dying a death by a thousand cuts. Yes, Microsoft still makes billions by selling pre-installed Windows via computer manufacturers. But ever-so-gradually, the Internet is upending its business model just as surely as it has upended models for the music, television and newspaper businesses. It is also true, as Mr. Gapper notes, that Bill Gates saw this coming many years ago -- and sounded the alarm in a famous memo to Microsoft's executives. But in the subsequent decade-plus, the company has been unable to keep it from happening.  Think about it: do you really care anymore which operating system you use? I don't. For years, I owned both a PC and a Mac. I could use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Apple's Safari or Mozilla's Firefox, more or less interchangeably, to access the Internet. I could write an article on one computer, send it via an email message to the other one, and it worked just fine. Ditto for PowerPoint, spreadsheets, and many of the other applications most people use -- including Apple's iTunes. Even my teenage sons, who stuck with Windows because most computer games were written for PCs, stopped caring. They could play games over the Internet, and all the most popular games were made for the Mac as well. I'm convinced that iTunes and the iPhone are not the only reasons Mac is gaining market share. The other is that people have come to realize that they do not really need Windows anymore. Any ol' operating system will do. The browser and the Internet have already rendered them largely irrelevant.  I've long believed that the key moment in the modern history of Microsoft can in the mid-1990s, when two key executives battled over which direction the company should go. Brad Silverberg argued that the company should stop trying to protect Windows at all costs, and embrace the Internet. James Allchin, who led the Windows team, said that the operating system was the company's bedrock, and its biggest source of profits, and that the Windows monopoly had to be protected no matter what.

(Larry Crowe/Associated Press)) Several months ago, I moved to my own apartment after years of sharing with a rotating roster of roommates. For a while I liked the solitude, but as the days got shorter and grayer that solitude changed colors too; what had been serene in summer was sort of lonely in winter. And so I had different friends over a few nights last week, for, among other things, holiday drinks.  The idea behind the holiday drinks evening (the guest list was just me and my friend Mike) was mostly to determine how certain holiday drinks are actually made, and to hit the punchbowl, so to speak. Hot buttered rum \u2014 what is that, really, we wondered. Surely you don't just heat up some rum and throw a pat of butter in, though Mike claimed he knew a girl in college who did just that. It was awful, he said, definitely not right. We also thought of making eggnog, just because I was curious about whether I would like the homemade kind significantly better than the stuff you buy in the carton (that I would like it better was assumed; it was the margin that was in question). Milk punch was also on the table as an option. I'd never heard of milk punch, which Mike described as a lighter version of eggnog.   I searched The New York Times site and came up with a bunch of options, including an updated version of Craig Claiborne's eggnog recipe that ran in the magazine last year, which Amanda Hesser described as a \"giant bowl of faintly boozy chiffon,\" a description that both intimidated and thrilled me. Could we consume a giant bowl of boozy chiffon? No, we decided. Too much.  Milk punch, from a 2001 recipe by Julia Reed, seemed a better bet. It turned out to be lighter insofar as the recipe doesn't call for eggs; the final texture, too, is more milky than creamy, making it more downable than your average nog (a dangerous thing).   The hot buttered rum recipe was a bit older, from a 1960 article titled \"Hot Buttered Rum Skiers' Choice,\" in which the reporter took an informal survey of skiers as they came in from the slopes and found that, though there was no one clear favorite, hot buttered rum had a slight edge. (Except with the mixologist David A. Embury, who remarked, \"Of all the hot liquors, I regard buttered rum as the worst. I believe that the drinking of it should be permitted only in the 'Northwest Passage' and, even there, only by highly imaginative and overenthusiastic novelists.\")  It turns out that hot buttered rum is actually hot water mixed with only a shot of rum, cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg, and just a bit of butter. And it was delicious, like tea in taste and consistency. It did not dethrone my favorite winter drink \u2014 the hot toddy, which is made with whiskey \u2014 but was fragrant and warming.  Mike preferred the hot buttered rum; I liked the milk punch better. A matter of apples and oranges, or rather, creamy and tea-like. To each their own.  All these recipes, along with hundreds of others, are now searchable in a database (currently in beta; it will be vastly expanded) on the Dining section. You can also check out the Times's Recipes page and use that as a jumping off point. Or you can just search our site for what you want.  I think sometime this week I may make this apple pancake recipe from an essay that the magazine published in December 2001. I'm working on Christmas this year, and though I won't be alone, something about the loneliness of this essay, and the resolution \u2014 the writer savors an enormous apple pancake that sounds more like a sweet deep-dish pizza \u2014 rang true with me.  It also reminds me of a dish I used to eat, either with friends or my family, at a place in West Caldwell, N. J., called the Original Pancake House (a national chain, but we didn't know then and I sort of wish I didn't now). A big bubbling mess of dough, not always entirely cooked through, sugar, cinnamon and apples, it was sweet and warm and gooey and delicious, and if it didn't make you feel better when it was gray and cold outside for the tenth day in a row, I'm not sure what would.

A computer requires an operating system such as Windows, Apple's OS X or Linux to make the machine work. It does, however, have the potential to do what Mr. Gates feared: make the choice of operating system less important.\"  So writes John Gapper, the fine columnist for The Financial Times in today's paper. Chrome, of course, is Google's new browser, which is pretty explicitly designed to be a Windows killer. As Mr. Gapper notes, that precise fear -- that an Internet browser could become such a powerful platform for applications software that it would effectively take over the function of the operating system -- is what caused Microsoft to start the browser wars in the 1990s, effectively putting Netscape out of business.  But it seems to me that even without the browser-as-platform, Windows is already dying a death by a thousand cuts. Yes, Microsoft still makes billions by selling pre-installed Windows via computer manufacturers. But ever-so-gradually, the Internet is upending its business model just as surely as it has upended models for the music, television and newspaper businesses. It is also true, as Mr. Gapper notes, that Bill Gates saw this coming many years ago -- and sounded the alarm in a famous memo to Microsoft's executives. But in the subsequent decade-plus, the company has been unable to keep it from happening.  Think about it: do you really care anymore which operating system you use? I don't. For years, I owned both a PC and a Mac. I could use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Apple's Safari or Mozilla's Firefox, more or less interchangeably, to access the Internet. I could write an article on one computer, send it via an email message to the other one, and it worked just fine. Ditto for PowerPoint, spreadsheets, and many of the other applications most people use -- including Apple's iTunes. Even my teenage sons, who stuck with Windows because most computer games were written for PCs, stopped caring. They could play games over the Internet, and all the most popular games were made for the Mac as well. I'm convinced that iTunes and the iPhone are not the only reasons Mac is gaining market share. The other is that people have come to realize that they do not really need Windows anymore. Any ol' operating system will do. The browser and the Internet have already rendered them largely irrelevant.  I've long believed that the key moment in the modern history of Microsoft can in the mid-1990s, when two key executives battled over which direction the company should go. Brad Silverberg argued that the company should stop trying to protect Windows at all costs, and embrace the Internet. James Allchin, who led the Windows team, said that the operating system was the company's bedrock, and its biggest source of profits, and that the Windows monopoly had to be protected no matter what. (This battle is wonderfully recounted in David Bank's much underrated 2001 book, \"Breaking Windows.\")  In the end, of course, Mr. Allchin won the battle, Mr. Silverberg left the company -- and Microsoft has been a day late and a dollar short on all things Internet ever since. The ultimate consequence of that decision may well be that Google will win the war.

Now it must go up against a Jaunty Jackalope as well.   The Jaunty Jackalope moniker is the latest animal-themed name used by Canonical, a maker of open source software, to describe an upcoming version of Ubuntu, its flavor of the Linux operating system. Other names used for previous releases of Ubuntu have included Hardy Heron, Dapper Drake and Breezy Badger. While the names may seem silly, they reflect part of the culture that has helped Ubuntu become a legitimate player in both the desktop and server operating system markets.  The geek elite use Linux, which is an operating system built with open source software that serves the same basic functions as Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Mac OS X. Of late, members of that geek elite have tended to choose Ubuntu as their favorite version of Linux. (There are hundreds, if not thousands, of variations on Linux, each with their own collections of applications and features.)  In December, Google will host a developer conference around Ubuntu at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. One of the main topics of discussion should be Jaunty Jackalope, which will likely ship next April in final form.   Canonical expects this version of the operating system to boast improvements in the speed at which the software boots up. \"Let's see if we can make booting or resuming Ubuntu blindingly quick,\" wrote Canonical's chief executive Mark Shuttleworth, in a note to developers.   In addition, Canonical plans on catering to the \"cloud,\" where users tap applications stored on central servers rather than firing up something like Microsoft Office right on their desktop. Shuttleworth was very vague about how Canonical intends to ride the cloud but said the company is after \"weblications.\"   The rabid interest in Ubuntu by both software developers and technology managers has helped the operating system come out of nowhere to rival long-standing Linux operating systems built by Red Hat and Novell.  To be sure, Red Hat remains the dominant version of Linux picked up by large companies. But the grass-roots interest in Ubuntu has opened some doors for the operating system. For example, Google uses a customized version of the software called Goobuntu for internal operations. In addition, PC giant Dell now offers Ubuntu as an option on some desktop and laptop machines.   Besides Ubuntu's popularity with the tech crowd, the South African-born Shuttleworth is a big reason for the software's success.   In 1999, VeriSign bought Shuttleworth's company, Thawte (pronounced \"thought\"), for $575 million. (Shuttleworth used $20 million of that money to purchase a trip to the International Space Station in 2002.)   With Shuttleworth's fortune backing Canonical, the company can battle against giants such as Microsoft and Apple without fearing for its near-term survival.   Shuttleworth concedes that the goofy names -- a jackalope, after all is a mythical creature -- are a personal indulgence.  \"No excuse, I'm afraid,\" he said in an interview conducted via e-mail. \"I deserve the blame for this. The buck / drake / eft / fawn / heron / ibex / jackalope stops here, so to speak. We learned a while ago that our sanity depended on making the names alphabetical, so the next one will be the K* K* but beyond that, it's not a sophisticated process.\"  \"K,\" he added, \"is going to be very, very hard.\"  Beyond keeping the Canonical folks sane, you can argue that the names help separate Ubuntu from the crowd.  \"I think anything that's remotely entertaining keeps people interested,\" said Dave Rosenberg, the co-founder of another oddly named open source player, MuleSource.   Canonical is expected to release a version of Ubuntu called Intrepid Ibex next month.

Now it must go up against a Jaunty Jackalope as well.   The Jaunty Jackalope moniker is the latest animal-themed name used by Canonical, a maker of open source software, to describe an upcoming version of Ubuntu, its flavor of the Linux operating system. Other names used for previous releases of Ubuntu have included Hardy Heron, Dapper Drake and Breezy Badger. While the names may seem silly, they reflect part of the culture that has helped Ubuntu become a legitimate player in both the desktop and server operating system markets.  The geek elite use Linux, which is an operating system built with open source software that serves the same basic functions as Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Mac OS X. Of late, members of that geek elite have tended to choose Ubuntu as their favorite version of Linux. (There are hundreds, if not thousands, of variations on Linux, each with their own collections of applications and features.)  In December, Google will host a developer conference around Ubuntu at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. One of the main topics of discussion should be Jaunty Jackalope, which will likely ship next April in final form.   Canonical expects this version of the operating system to boast improvements in the speed at which the software boots up. \"Let's see if we can make booting or resuming Ubuntu blindingly quick,\" wrote Canonical's chief executive Mark Shuttleworth, in a note to developers.   In addition, Canonical plans on catering to the \"cloud,\" where users tap applications stored on central servers rather than firing up something like Microsoft Office right on their desktop. Shuttleworth was very vague about how Canonical intends to ride the cloud but said the company is after \"weblications.\"   The rabid interest in Ubuntu by both software developers and technology managers has helped the operating system come out of nowhere to rival long-standing Linux operating systems built by Red Hat and Novell.  To be sure, Red Hat remains the dominant version of Linux picked up by large companies. But the grass-roots interest in Ubuntu has opened some doors for the operating system. For example, Google uses a customized version of the software called Goobuntu for internal operations. In addition, PC giant Dell now offers Ubuntu as an option on some desktop and laptop machines.   Besides Ubuntu's popularity with the tech crowd, the South African-born Shuttleworth is a big reason for the software's success.   In 1999, VeriSign bought Shuttleworth's company, Thawte (pronounced \"thought\"), for $575 million. (Shuttleworth used $20 million of that money to purchase a trip to the International Space Station in 2002.)   With Shuttleworth's fortune backing Canonical, the company can battle against giants such as Microsoft and Apple without fearing for its near-term survival.   Shuttleworth concedes that the goofy names -- a jackalope, after all is a mythical creature -- are a personal indulgence.  \"No excuse, I'm afraid,\" he said in an interview conducted via e-mail. \"I deserve the blame for this. The buck / drake / eft / fawn / heron / ibex / jackalope stops here, so to speak. We learned a while ago that our sanity depended on making the names alphabetical, so the next one will be the K* K* but beyond that, it's not a sophisticated process.\"  \"K,\" he added, \"is going to be very, very hard.\"  Beyond keeping the Canonical folks sane, you can argue that the names help separate Ubuntu from the crowd.  \"I think anything that's remotely entertaining keeps people interested,\" said Dave Rosenberg, the co-founder of another oddly named open source player, MuleSource.   Canonical is expected to release a version of Ubuntu called Intrepid Ibex next month.

"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/blogs/09bits-the-jaun1480.html", "snippet": "Canonical, the corporate sponsor of the Ubuntu operating system, said its newest version, the Jaunty Jackalope, should boot faster and cater to Web-based applications.", "lead_paragraph": "Microsoft has spent years battling an Apple. Now it must go up against a Jaunty Jackalope as well.   The Jaunty Jackalope moniker is the latest animal-themed name used by Canonical, a maker of open source software, to describe an upcoming version of Ubuntu, its flavor of the Linux operating system. Other names used for previous releases of Ubuntu have included Hardy Heron, Dapper Drake and Breezy Badger. While the names may seem silly, they reflect part of the culture that has helped Ubuntu become a legitimate player in both the desktop and server operating system markets.  The geek elite use Linux, which is an operating system built with open source software that serves the same basic functions as Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Mac OS X. Of late, members of that geek elite have tended to choose Ubuntu as their favorite version of Linux. (There are hundreds, if not thousands, of variations on Linux, each with their own collections of applications and features.)  In December, Google will host a developer conference around Ubuntu at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. One of the main topics of discussion should be Jaunty Jackalope, which will likely ship next April in final form.   Canonical expects this version of the operating system to boast improvements in the speed at which the software boots up. \"Let's see if we can make booting or resuming Ubuntu blindingly quick,\" wrote Canonical's chief executive Mark Shuttleworth, in a note to developers.   In addition, Canonical plans on catering to the \"cloud,\" where users tap applications stored on central servers rather than firing up something like Microsoft Office right on their desktop. Shuttleworth was very vague about how Canonical intends to ride the cloud but said the company is after \"weblications.\"   The rabid interest in Ubuntu by both software developers and technology managers has helped the operating system come out of nowhere to rival long-standing Linux operating systems built by Red Hat and Novell.  To be sure, Red Hat remains the dominant version of Linux picked up by large companies. But the grass-roots interest in Ubuntu has opened some doors for the operating system. For example, Google uses a customized version of the software called Goobuntu for internal operations. In addition, PC giant Dell now offers Ubuntu as an option on some desktop and laptop machines.   Besides Ubuntu's popularity with the tech crowd, the South African-born Shuttleworth is a big reason for the software's success.   In 1999, VeriSign bought Shuttleworth's company, Thawte (pronounced \"thought\"), for $575 million. (Shuttleworth used $20 million of that money to purchase a trip to the International Space Station in 2002.)   With Shuttleworth's fortune backing Canonical, the company can battle against giants such as Microsoft and Apple without fearing for its near-term survival.   Shuttleworth concedes that the goofy names -- a jackalope, after all is a mythical creature -- are a personal indulgence.  \"No excuse, I'm afraid,\" he said in an interview conducted via e-mail. \"I deserve the blame for this. The buck / drake / eft / fawn / heron / ibex / jackalope stops here, so to speak. We learned a while ago that our sanity depended on making the names alphabetical, so the next one will be the K* K* but beyond that, it's not a sophisticated process.\"  \"K,\" he added, \"is going to be very, very hard.\"  Beyond keeping the Canonical folks sane, you can argue that the names help separate Ubuntu from the crowd.  \"I think anything that's remotely entertaining keeps people interested,\" said Dave Rosenberg, the co-founder of another oddly named open source player, MuleSource.   Canonical is expected to release a version of Ubuntu called Intrepid Ibex next month.

Bits readers are invited to offer their own ideas on how to show off Vista\u2019s virtues.", "lead_paragraph": "Whenever we write about Microsoft and its Vista operating system, we get a flood of comments from Bits readers. Many write off the software company and Windows as simply so over. Others are long-time fans who feel let down.   But a certain hardy minority think that the criticism is overblown and actually like using Vista. It is to them that this post is directed.   Microsoft has released the latest three commercials in its huge ad campaign meant to counter all the negative talk about Vista.   The spots play off the hilarious and effective Apple Macintosh commercials. They start out with a Microsoft employee who looks a lot like John Hodgman, from the Apple spots, saying \"Hello, I'm a PC.\" And then they show a bunch of people all over the world saying, \"I'm a PC.\"   Below is one of the ads:    The two others are here and here.   I rather like the commercials, even if they sort of resemble this old riff from \"Sesame Street\". They use a nice sense of humor to highlight one unarguable fact: More computers use Windows than any other operating system.   But the ads don't actually tell people why they should choose a Vista machine over a Mac.   So here's a challenge to Bits readers who like Vista: What would your commercial be to convince people they have the wrong idea about the operating system?  Post your proposed commercials in the comments below. If you want to make a video, you can embed a code from YouTube (or wherever) in the comments. If you want to draw a storyboard, you can upload it to Flickr, etc., and embed an image. Obviously, we'll moderate the images to make sure they are appropriate. If you need help with any of that, simply e-mail us at bits@nytimes.com with the image or link, and we'll help as best we can.   I know some of you are going to want to create your commercials that tout the wonders of incompatible drivers and the fun of the blue screen of death. I'm not going to stop you, but if we get a lot, we may set a high bar for these. The question here is what would really sell Vista.

FireWire is a connector, originally developed and promoted by Apple itself, that lets you import video from a tape camcorder for easy editing. It was a cornerstone of Apple's \"anyone can edit video\" revolution.  Over 400 of you responded, by e-mail or on the Pogue's Posts feedback forum. Most of you were equally alarmed; many of you have stacks of MiniDV tapes, as I do, that, in a post-FireWire world, you'll have no way to transfer to a computer for editing.   But one e-mail response stopped me cold:  \"What makes you think you'll have any grandchildren with the time and inclination to sit through more than a few minutes of your home videos?   \"The movies an uncle shot of me and my siblings a few decades ago were projected for about 30 minutes a decade ago, and have not been looked at again by anybody.   \"Home movies require a captive audience, for long periods. How many hours could you bestow on your children right now? How many hours would you expect them to sit still for them? And unlike photographs, home movies can't really be dipped into, flipped through.   \"I'm not against home movies. I just question whether the people amassing them at great length have much idea of what they require of the people in them, or who inherit them.  \"Kind regards, good luck. I respect your affection for your family.\"  I did a lot of thinking about this.   Why do I film every vacation, every schoolyear highlight, every birthday party? Why am I so upset that format loss (including the FireWire jack) might make all of my videos unwatchable?   Clearly, I'm not alone; the crazy-fast sales of digital cameras, year after year, teach us that recording our lives is a fundamental human instinct.   But why, exactly, do we spend hundreds of dollars on equipment to film and store our pictures and videos, without any assurance that anyone will ever want to view them?   In short: why do we shoot?  Maybe it's just ego. Maybe we record our lives as a hedge against mortality, hoping that some scrap of our lives will live on after us.  And maybe my correspondent is right. Maybe we're fooling ourselves. Maybe, to some extent, home video and amateur photography are mass delusions on a global scale--a gigantic expenditure of money, time and expertise to create a visual record that, ultimately, nobody will ever see.  But then I considered my own motives, and I have an answer to \"Why I shoot.\" Lots of them, actually. First of all, I object to the \"captive audience\" notion. The whole *point* of transferring video to your computer is so that you can edit it down.   In the early days of fatherhood, when I was a little less busy than I am now, I routinely created five- or six-minute videos: distilled, funny, entertaining highlight reels of our life. And visiting neighbors actually *asked* to see them. (Search YouTube for \"Pogue Extreme Baby\" to see an example.)   But anyway, here are some of the reasons why I shoot video.  1. For our older selves. Life is fleeting, especially when our children are cute and innocent and still dependent on us. Video and photos are the best way we've got to revisit these chaotic, happy days years from now, when they're grown up and moved away.  2. For our descendants. My correspondent may be right; it's not clear how interested our descendants will be in watching our ancient videos--if, indeed, our recordings don't get lost to changing hardware and software standards.   But you never know. Your kid may become famous, or infamous, and the 2025 edition of \"Entertainment Tonight\" or \"60 Minutes\" might consider those old movies a gold mine. O.K., it's not likely, but it could happen.  Furthermore, your descendants just *might* be interested in your life. I, for one, would love to see videos of my own ancestors. My grandfather spent ten years compiling a great big self-published Pogue genealogy, filled with carefully researched facts--but that's all. Names, dates, places. I'd find it much more interesting to know about their personalities, foibles, facial expressions and accents--to know the people, not just their stats.   3. For pleasure. Getting into photography or video is fun. They can be artistic endeavors, satisfying just to participate. I love trying to improve my shooting, my composition, my technique. It's a hobby.  (And by the way, \"home movies\" isn't always the same as \"amateur movies.\" Not all amateur movies are intended to document family life, as some of the better YouTube bits clearly demonstrate.)  4. For historians. The home videos of today might become a valuable archive for historians of the future. Remember: an enormous percentage of today's videos are going to disappear, as their tapes crumble and video players become obsolete. So if 2 percent of it survives, we'll be lucky. Therefore, the more we film today, the better.  5. For posterity. Finally, suppose that my correspondent is correct that thousands of people shoot video because they believe, mistakenly, that their descendants will give a darn. Suppose that much, or even most, of what we photograph and film will, in fact, never be seen by anyone.  You know what? Fine. We admit it: We're shooting on faith. Believing that somebody *might* someday be interested in your videos inspires and drives us.   Look, we do all kinds of things based on faith. People expend all kinds of effort now because they hope, without any guarantees, that it will pay off down the line: get married, worship, drink a glass of wine every day. It's human nature.   And it's human to want to record our lives, too.   And that's why I shoot.

The G1 cellphone from T-Mobile. Enlarge This Image   UPDATE 11:26 a.m.  Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, make a surprise appearance at the end of the event. They both talk about how the phone is a geek's dream. Mr. Brin talks about how he wrote his own application, using the phone's accelerometer, that allows you to throw the phone up in the air then (hopefully) catch it. The App will time how long it was in the air.  \"We didn't release it, but maybe I should put it up on the App store,\" he mused. (Yes Google will run an app store for all the phones that use its Android operating system just like Apple.)  In the closest anyone got to discussing Google's business model, Mr. Page noted that it's hard to search the Internet when you are away from a computer.  \"It's hard to carry your laptop with you all the time, especially when you are roller blading,\" he said. The Android phone will bring search (and all the money Google makes from it) to people's pockets.  UPDATE 11:12 a.m.  Some facts from the demo videos:  My first impression is it is a lot like an iPhone, only with a pop-out keyboard. The differences that we can see are subtle. There is a different interface feature: if you hold the touchscreen down for several seconds, what Google calls a \"long press,\" up pops a menu of other things you can do, much like the right mouse button on a PC. When shopping on the Amazon store, it brings up related merchandise. When surfing the Web, it gives options for sharing the page. Apple, the devotee of one button mice, doesn't have a context menu on the iPhone.  One of the crucial differences in the software is that it allows several applications to run at the same time. That means you can still receive an instant message from a friend while you surf the Internet. Apple said multi-tasking takes up too much system resource.  Not surprisingly, there is a lot of integration with Google. There is a button on the keyboard to bring up search. And Google Maps is woven through the service, including its Street View collection of photos. That means as you walk through a city, you can look at photos of where you are as well as simply looking around.      UPDATE 11:07 a.m.  Finally the key facts: In the United States, the price is $179, $20 less than the iPhone. The official launch date is October 22. But it will roll out over several weeks, and will be available in cities representing 80 percent of the population by November. Existing T-mobile customers can order them now on a special Web site.  It will be available in Britain in early November and in the rest of Europe next year.  T-Mobile has two data plans: $25 per month for limited data, e-mail and text messages. $35 a month for unlimited data and messages.  ---------------------------------- I'm here at the Google, T-Mobile press conference.  They are definitely going for style of substance. It is in a vast space under the 59th Steet Bridge. They couldn't have picked a less convenient place, all the way on the East Side on a day when world leaders and their limos are clogging the streets near the United Nations. The G1 cellphone from T-Mobile. Enlarge This Image     The press kit we were given has some photos of the new phone, known as the G1, and a fact sheet (without some of the important facts, like the price).    As we reported, it has a big color screen and a flip out keyboard. You can navigate by a track ball, in addition to a touch screen.  \"The keyboard of the G1 will appeal to a wide variety of people,\" said Peter Chou, the chief executive of HTC, which manufactures the phone. In the introductory remarks. Everyone is repeating \"mobile Internet\" and \"open\" as much as possible.  The phone will be able to watch YouTube videos, send IMs on Google and several other instant message systems, and run a few applications:  o ShopSavvy: designed to help people do comparative shopping  o Ecorio: developed to help people keep track of their daily travels and view what their carbon footprint looks like  o BreadCrumbz: enables people to create a step-by-step visual map using photos; customers can create their own routes, share them with friends or with the world  o Amazon MP3 Store (pre-installed on the device): enables people to search DRM-free, full-track MP3 music and download that music from Amazon directly to their device using a Wi-Fi connection    The hardware also has a music player, GPS navigation, Bluetooth connections, and a MicroSD slot for expansion. T-Mobile says it has five hours of talk time and 130 hours of standby time.

The G1 cellphone from T-Mobile. Enlarge This Image   UPDATE 11:26 a.m.  Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, make a surprise appearance at the end of the event. They both talk about how the phone is a geek's dream. Mr. Brin talks about how he wrote his own application, using the phone's accelerometer, that allows you to throw the phone up in the air then (hopefully) catch it. The App will time how long it was in the air.  \"We didn't release it, but maybe I should put it up on the App store,\" he mused. (Yes Google will run an app store for all the phones that use its Android operating system just like Apple.)  In the closest anyone got to discussing Google's business model, Mr. Page noted that it's hard to search the Internet when you are away from a computer.  \"It's hard to carry your laptop with you all the time, especially when you are roller blading,\" he said. The Android phone will bring search (and all the money Google makes from it) to people's pockets.  UPDATE 11:12 a.m.  Some facts from the demo videos:  My first impression is it is a lot like an iPhone, only with a pop-out keyboard. The differences that we can see are subtle. There is a different interface feature: if you hold the touchscreen down for several seconds, what Google calls a \"long press,\" up pops a menu of other things you can do, much like the right mouse button on a PC. When shopping on the Amazon store, it brings up related merchandise. When surfing the Web, it gives options for sharing the page. Apple, the devotee of one button mice, doesn't have a context menu on the iPhone.  One of the crucial differences in the software is that it allows several applications to run at the same time. That means you can still receive an instant message from a friend while you surf the Internet. Apple said multi-tasking takes up too much system resource.  Not surprisingly, there is a lot of integration with Google. There is a button on the keyboard to bring up search. And Google Maps is woven through the service, including its Street View collection of photos. That means as you walk through a city, you can look at photos of where you are as well as simply looking around.      UPDATE 11:07 a.m.  Finally the key facts: In the United States, the price is $179, $20 less than the iPhone. The official launch date is October 22. But it will roll out over several weeks, and will be available in cities representing 80 percent of the population by November. Existing T-mobile customers can order them now on a special Web site.  It will be available in Britain in early November and in the rest of Europe next year.  T-Mobile has two data plans: $25 per month for limited data, e-mail and text messages. $35 a month for unlimited data and messages.  ---------------------------------- I'm here at the Google, T-Mobile press conference.  They are definitely going for style of substance. It is in a vast space under the 59th Steet Bridge. They couldn't have picked a less convenient place, all the way on the East Side on a day when world leaders and their limos are clogging the streets near the United Nations. The G1 cellphone from T-Mobile. Enlarge This Image     The press kit we were given has some photos of the new phone, known as the G1, and a fact sheet (without some of the important facts, like the price).    As we reported, it has a big color screen and a flip out keyboard. You can navigate by a track ball, in addition to a touch screen.  \"The keyboard of the G1 will appeal to a wide variety of people,\" said Peter Chou, the chief executive of HTC, which manufactures the phone. In the introductory remarks. Everyone is repeating \"mobile Internet\" and \"open\" as much as possible.  The phone will be able to watch YouTube videos, send IMs on Google and several other instant message systems, and run a few applications:  o ShopSavvy: designed to help people do comparative shopping  o Ecorio: developed to help people keep track of their daily travels and view what their carbon footprint looks like  o BreadCrumbz: enables people to create a step-by-step visual map using photos; customers can create their own routes, share them with friends or with the world  o Amazon MP3 Store (pre-installed on the device): enables people to search DRM-free, full-track MP3 music and download that music from Amazon directly to their device using a Wi-Fi connection    The hardware also has a music player, GPS navigation, Bluetooth connections, and a MicroSD slot for expansion. T-Mobile says it has five hours of talk time and 130 hours of standby time.

(Photo: Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times)) Joan Nathan replies to a third batch of readers' questions about Rosh Hashana and Jewish food.  Q.  My family is Sephardic, leaving Spain with the Inquisition and traveling through the Ottoman Empire to end up in Egypt. As I have gotten older and started cooking recipes passed down to me, I have become very interested tracing the history and politics pertaining to our dishes and food customs. Do you have any suggestions for how to begin my research? -- Arielle  Joan replies:  Look at all the Sephardic cookbooks that are out and look for recipes that sound like home. You will learn about your own journey.   Q. Growing up, I remember the traditional high holydays dessert honey cake being dry, tasteless, and with a texture somewhere between sand and cardboard. even a scoop of ice cream (our home was not kosher) wouldn't help. Any suggestions? \u2014 Richard     Joan replies: Richard, I couldn't agree with you more about honey cake. Most are dry and just don't taste good. Try the one from my earlier set of responses. I think the problem is over baking and not keeping them fresh and covered well.   Q. Do you have any recommendations for what a well-meaning goyishe boyfriend can bring to the family Rosh Hashana gathering? This is my third one. The first year I panicked and brought way too many bottles of kosher for Passover wine, which the family is still working through. Last year I chickened out and brought flowers. -- Shiksa boyfriend   Joan replies:  Why not try your hand at baking a round hallah or bring a basket of new fruits of the season like pomegranates, heirloom apples, blue plums, and dates and some good artisanal honey for a sweet new year.   Q. Do you have a good recipe for Jerusalem Kugel or as it is called in hebrew Kugel Yerushalmi (which is a traditional Rosh Hashana dish)? Last year I made it and it came out too greasy. many thanks. -- Leah   Joan replies: I love Jerusalem Kugel. Why don't you try this kugel from my \"Foods of Israel Today'' cookbook.   JERUSALEM PEPPERY KUGEL  2 \u00bd teaspoons salt 12 ounces capellini or other thin spaghetti  \u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup sugar 1/3 cup vegetable oil  1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. 2. Bring 6 cups of water to boil in a pot, add \u00bd teaspoon of the salt and cook capellini or spaghetti for about 5 minutes, or according to package directions, until al dente. Drain, rinse in cold water, and place in a bowl.  3. Add pepper, remaining salt, eggs, and 2/3 cup of sugar. Mix well. 4. Heat oil in a small saucepan and add remaining 1/3 cup of the sugar. Mix well and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar melts and starts to turn brown. Keep an eye on this, for once it begins to color, it will get dark quickly.  5. Pour caramelized sugar over pasta, mixing well. Don't worry if some of the caramel hardens, it will soften later.  6. Grease a Bundt pan and pour spaghetti in. Cover with tin foil and bake in the middle rack of the oven for 2 hours. If you like a crustier top, take the foil off for the last half hour of cooking.   Yield: 6 to 8 servings  Note: For an old Sephardic Jerusalem variation, add to the cooked pasta the following ingredients: 2/3 cup of plumped raisins, 3 sauteed onions, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 clove garlic, crushed, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1 teaspoon salt. Proceed as above.   Q. Do you know where can I find carp in Manhattan, and if not carp, what other fish should I use for Gefilte Fish and where can I buy them? -- Addi.   Joan replies: Go to Citarella. Sometimes, though, you have to call up for special orders. By the way, carp used to run in the Hudson River.   Q. I was wondering if you had any tips for preparing brisket that don't rely so heavily on onions (I'm in my first trimester with my second child and I can't stand the smell of them!). -- Jennifer  Joan replies: Try that Atlanta panacea called Coca Cola Brisket. Chili sauce, onion soup mix, and a can of Coca Cola.   Q. When I was growing up in Albany, N.Y., a favorite anytime -- but especially around the holidays -- was a walnut cake from Leo's Bakery. I have searched and tried various recipes but none comes close. This cake (definitely not a torte with egg whites beaten and folded in) was moist and dense, the nuts chopped or coarsely ground. It probably sat on a thin crust of some sort and had a layer or at least a topping of raspberry jam. He baked it in large sheets; it was about 3 inches high. Any ideas would be greatly  appreciated. \u2014 Ellen Rocco   Joan replies: That sounds like a Hungarian walnut torte to me. Look up in any Hungarian cookbook to find that one.  Q. I am curious to know what distinguishes recipes for Rosh Hashana from those of other Jewish holidays. For years, I've been using a wonderful apple cake recipe which I discovered in an article about Jewish cooking. I've always wondered what makes it unique, aside from the use of apples which are seasonal. Is it perhaps the use of cream cheese in the batter? I know that cream cheese is often used in other baked items in Jewish cuisine. -- Jennifer S.   Joan replies: Apples are new fruits of the season at Rosh Hashana and that is why they are used. So are carrots which mean to increase and multiply in German. For the same reason, pomegranates and many other seasonal vegetables and fruitsare used. Don't forget Rosh Hashana is also a harvest festival. If you look at the Rosh Hashana section of \"Joan Nathan's Jewish Holiday Cookbook'' you will see why you use all these vegetables and fruits.   Q. Thanks for suggesting a more diabetic-friendly recipe. Do you have any other suggestions in that vein? -- Susan   Joan replies: Cook your fruits down to get the true flavor of the fruit. That way you will need less sugar.  Q. I have been blessed with acceptances by all of my invited guests - so my usual gang of 10 is now 22! My guys like roast chicken/capon - but is there a way to roast multiple chickens through the day to serve later without drying them out? Any ideas for using the beautiful broccoli and caulifower that is in the markets now (do ahead); I was planning on just roasting, but that is so boring \u2014 Carolyn  Joan replies: Why not serve turkey instead of chicken. I think it will stay moister; or brown your chicken ahead and refrigerate. Just heat up in the oven before serving. I too love broccoli and cauliflower. I would put a little bread crumbs on them, brown them in the oven until they are sweet, and reheat just before serving.

Will it help the company finally gain name recognition?.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: An Autonomy billboard. (Credit: Autonomy))   One of the few constants in Silicon Valley has been a giant billboard set on a hill beside Highway 101, near San Francisco airport. For eight years, the billboard has carried a variety of messages from Autonomy, a high-end search company that few people know.   On Jan. 1, Autonomy will move across the highway, from the west side to the east side, ending an era.  The Autonomy billboard is an icon in the area, providing commuters with a visual cue that their long, congested drive to work is about to end. Other billboards have come and gone, but like a, er, beacon on a hill, the Autonomy signage has remained.   So, just about everyone in Silicon Valley should know about the company, right?   Ah, no. The slogans on the billboard haven't always been clear on what Autonomy does:  Autonomy: an Intelligent World What software is to computers, Autonomy is to software Automation through understanding  Autonomy, which is based in Cambridge, England, has mostly gone along with its business \"without people taking too much notice,\" said Stouffer Egan, the chief executive officer of the company's United States business.   Autonomy's identity issues stem from its complex line of technology.   Where companies like Google and Yahoo perform searches for words that appear on Web pages and others help businesses dig through databases, Autonomy handles the ugly stuff that's left over. It not only searches through legal documents, videos and sounds but also tries to derive some measure of meaning from the content.  So, if someone files a lawsuit against computer maker Apple, Autonomy's technology can churn through all of the documents collected by lawyers and remove, for example, e-mail messages that discuss apple pie recipes. Autonomy finds the relevant references.   The company handles more complex jobs as well, like scanning television transmissions as they're sent from broadcast stations to satellites, translating those feeds and flagging up portions of the broadcast that align with desired topics. Autonomy obviously counts a number of three-letter government agencies as customers.   Explaining all of that on a billboard proves pretty tough, but Autonomy has kept right on advertising anyway.   The billboard provides a reminder of the company's stability to customers visiting its United States headquarters in San Francisco, according to Mr. Egan. It's also a reminder to workers in Silicon Valley that there are software jobs available in San Francisco rather than just in the suburbs.   \"It imparts to a CIO or general counsel that this is a substantial company with a strong balance sheet and a name you should know,\" Mr. Egan said. \"Even if the raw impressions are lower, we're making a conscious effort to speak to that group.\"  Unlike most of the technology industry, Autonomy seems to be bucking the economic downturn. For the third quarter, Autonomy posted a 42 percent rise in revenue to $127.1 million, and net profit more than doubled, capping off a string of 35 profitable quarters in a row. The company's shares, which are traded in London, are up about 19 percent over the last year.  \"We are humbly fortunate enough to be positioned in a way that is a nice hedge against the economic cloud,\" Mr. Egan said. \"Autonomy has a pretty decent chunk of its proposition rooted in addressing compliance and litigation readiness. The appetite for that is quite high in this environment.\"  Indeed, Autonomy owes its new billboard position, considered a great spot to catch the eye of taxi riders on the way to San Francisco, to the sagging economy. The company is displacing Gap, the struggling clothing retailer.   \"Retail has really slowed down quite a bit,\" said Nicole Eagan, Autonomy's chief marketing officer. \"That opened up a prime opportunity for us.\" ", "abstract": "Autonomy's iconic billboard in San Francisco is crossing the road.

Like Facebook and Apple with its iPhone, San Francisco-based Twitter has successfully captured the attention and energies of third-party developers, who have unleashed a wave of both practical and trivial applications that work with it.   We have chronicled a few this week, not because these particular Twitter tools are going to take over the world, but because they speak to the larger wave of innovation that is making the service much more than the sum of its parts.  So here's another one that caught our eye: Tweetmas. The app, developed by the London-based Crowdstorm, allows Twitter users to tell their followers what is on their wish lists for the holidays.   Like everything else with Twitter these days, amid the noisy clutter of 140-characters-or-less posts are some truly interesting and odd gems and trends. Among those using Tweetmas seriously, the Wii, iPod Touch and various coffee machines seem to be in vogue this year.   Then there are the more outlandish requests, such as:  A cure for my insomnia.  A maid to clean my room.  My girlfriend to stop ignoring me.  For Chocolate not to show on my hips.  I want this blond chubby Finnish girl wearing only those red Christmas laces.

(Photo: ) Let me suggest that people are phrasing the question slightly wrong: Yahoo doesn't need a chief executive so much as an editor in chief. And I mean the sort of imperial editor who has a vision of how to create an environment that lures in both readers and advertisers, like Tina Brown, Clay Felker or Adam Moss.   In most conversations about the job, I hear people dismissing many names because this or that person \"doesn't have enough management expertise.\" They say Yahoo is a big and complex business, and the ideal head should have run some sort of conglomerate.  That leads people to turn to names like Peter Chernin, the No. 2 executive at the News Corporation. That company, particularly the Hollywood parts in which Mr. Chernin specializes, is very much a portfolio business. You buy companies. You finance movies. You schedule TV shows. You bet on good managers, producers and directors. If you are right more than you are wrong -- as Mr. Chernin and his boss Rupert Murdoch have been -- the combination can make a lot of money.  I don't think that is the sort of boss Yahoo needs.   Indeed, part of the company's problems have come from thinking of its business as a portfolio of 100 loosely connected sites: Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Games, Yahoo Briefcase and so on. What's been lacking is a unified vision of what Yahoo stands for and how its parts fit together into a coherent experience.   That's what makes me think of those legendary editors who can inspire (and perhaps bully) people to coalesce around an idea. (If I was sticking with Hollywoodspeak, more a director than a studio boss.)  The very best Internet executives I know obsess about the experience their company provides. By experience, I don't just mean the user interface or features of a site. I mean the entire proposition of the company -- what it offers, how it makes money, how it talks about and supports its services.  Jeff Bezos is the longstanding champion of this approach to running an Internet company. Of the pioneers, I'd say Halsey Minor, the co-founder and first chief executive of CNet, had that editor-in-chief drive to put quality into so many parts of his company.   Apple is not exactly an Internet company, but Steve Jobs is also in the mold I'm talking about. He doesn't run Apple as a conglomerate. And he doesn't delegate anything important. It might not be fun to work there, but to consumers, there is no doubt what the company stands for.  Of chief executives at the current crop of Internet companies, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook most epitomizes the approach I think Yahoo needs. He might not be on anyone's list to be the next Jack Welch. But Mr. Zuckerberg has an incredibly clear idea of what Facebook is and isn't. Look at how he resisted all the pressure to copy MySpace, and how he even pulled back from the more chaotic aspects of Facebook's application platform. MySpace will do well, but Mr. Zuckerberg is building to his vision, and it resonates -- with consumers at least. (Advertisers are an open question.)  When you look at the names of people who are being bandied about for Yahoo's top spot, none really strike me as being that kind of leader. Most of them are people who have run non-Internet businesses or run online companies in the conglomerate style.   Even Jonathan Miller spent most of his time at AOL trying to concoct a strategy for how to replace the Internet access business. I don't think you can see his fingerprints much on how users interact with the service.   I can hear the objections to this concept. Whoever runs Yahoo will need to think about a broad range of issues, deal with Wall Street and financial matters and delegate product details to the staff.   My answer is that Steve Jobs doesn't do any of those things. Some of the other executives I mentioned do, but there isn't much to talk to Wall Street about if you don't have a business proposition that makes sense to customers.

As long as the supply lasts, or until Dec. 31, AT&T is offering refurbished 8 GB iPhone 3Gs for $99 with a two-year contract (or to people who qualify for an upgrade). The 8 GB G3 usually sells new for $200. Don't rush to a store, though -- the refurbished phones can only be ordered online or by phone.   By refurbished, AT&T means someone else owned it first and returned it. The phone may show some wear, but it carries a 90-day warranty. New iPhones have a one-year warranty, according to an AT&T salesman I spoke to at the phone order center. AT&T representatives approached by phone and e-mail had not responded by the time this was posted.  Meanwhile, new iPhones are available at Wal-Mart, at a whopping discount of -- wait for it -- $2 off.  As I've said before, getting the iPhone into Wal-Mart doesn't seem like such big a deal. It may put it in front of some buyers who have only seen them on TV before, but I'm not sure that translates into tremendous sales.   Putting the iPhone in Wal-Mart is culturally significant, though. It shows how rapidly general acceptance of mobile computing is moving.

Clifford Dewey, who often drives over from Maryland in a white Lincoln Town Car known as the Tuna Boat, was the life of the party. Dewey's an outrageous flirt, quick with a quip or a slap on the back. The gals seem to dote on him. Sinatra would have approved.   Dewey and I talked about the country's future. \"Frightening,\" he said, and I prepared myself for the worst, but he meant frighteningly positive. The Depression, the big dip in the 1990s, we had weathered such economic turmoil before, and he believed we'd recover again. As a self-made man, Dewey trusted in human potential and the gift of opportunity.  He stamped his success story with the imprimatur Only in America. \"I'm lucky,\" he began. \"The Good Lord gave me a load of brains and the memory of an elephant. I had one of the highest IQs at my high school in Weymouth, Mass., and the lowest grades. Didn't even graduate. I started pumping gas at 16.\"  He joined the Navy to escape, grabbed a job as an auto mechanic on his return, moved up to selling parts, rose to the rank of general manager at 25, joined the giddy ride when his firm Car-Matic became a franchise, and cashed out for about a quarter-million in 1985, while also building a portfolio of investment properties.  Now Dewey's business card reads C.D. Dewey & Associates, International Financing, and it's no joke. He has fingers in many pies, including Dubai. He admitted he'd transferred some assets to an FDIC- insured bank, but he still had confidence in the dollar. He did feel bad for working people, though, who had only their paychecks to count on and no cushion of savings to soften the blow. They'd take the hardest hit.  Dewey urged me to try a slab of lasagna, but I had other plans. Falls Church is a polyglot place, with a vibrant mix of ethnic communities. I'd never eaten at a Bolivian restaurant before, so I voted with my feet for El Tutumaso, near my motel, where a delegation of Vietnamese dignitaries had attended a luncheon earlier that day.  I don't think Evo Morales was inside, but I'll give you 5-to-2 that a distant cousin sat before a plate of Pique Lo Macho or Silpancho. All the customers were Bolivian, as was the hip-hop on a flat screen TV, and family groups conversed quietly, while the kids dashed about. I heard no uproar of excited money, no bellow of power and circumstance. There was only the sweet mood of surcease that a Sunday evening deserves.  The Charque I ordered tested me, though. Shredded beef, some pozole-like corn kernels, boiled potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, a hot sauce I applied in heaping doses to prove to the server, who warned me to be careful, that I could handle it \u2014 well, I could not. I failed to win my Bolivian merit badge.  Farther down the road, as I veered from my original intention to stick to U.S. 50, a goal no true vagabond could ever fulfill, I reached Culpeper, Va., where the immigration I'd witnessed in Falls Church is a contentious issue, literally front-page news. The paper's other lead story addressed the question of whether or not citizens should be allowed to bear arms at public meetings.   Culpeper's recent history would be familiar to many other small American cities. It hit the skids about 20 years ago, and the downtown fell to drugs and prostitutes, but a concerted civic effort turned the tide, and now central Culpeper has a clean, smart, mildly trendy look that pleases both the locals and tourists.  (Photo: Ed Perryman. (Bill Barich)) On the other hand, its suburban fringe has a massive rate of foreclosure, the result of a brief construction boom before the recent collapse. It brought an army of eager Mexican laborers into the county, but now that the work has dried up, some folks in Culpeper would like the Mexicans to disappear, although Ed Perryman doesn't share that view. We bumped into each other on Main Street after an aggressive or stoned driver almost ran us down.  \"I'm going to be 80 pretty soon, in November,\" Perryman confided. \"I've been retired since '91, used to work for a paper company. I keep busy making furniture for those who ask. I started farm work as a boy for a dime a day \u2014 'course you could buy two pounds of beans for a quarter back then. The future looks pretty bad to me. Too much modern stuff. Too many white collars, and not enough people working.  \"The thing about the Mexicans is, they're good people. They treat me good and I treat them good. What I don't like is too much government. If I want to build a pigpen, I've got to get a permit now. I'm a Baptist and never been in trouble in my life. Never been in a jailhouse, either. 'Course, I had a couple of speeding tickets, but everybody gets a few of those.\"  Permits weren't a problem in Culpeper in the old days. If you wanted to shoot a varmint, the sheriff gave you one. He still will, but only if you have at least an acre of land. The clustered suburbs are a danger zone, in case a bullet goes astray. According to Beth Burns, who runs the tourist office, the controversy even attracted the attention of some \"gun fanatics\"' from northern Virginia. Adepts of the Second Amendment, they showed up for meetings packing heat, and the matter was referred to a committee.   Virginia is a so-called \"battleground state,\" as the Beltway pundits put it, and Beth says that the downtown area divides about evenly in terms of preference. Along East Street it's all McCain, and in her neighborhood it's all Obama, whose troops stole a march on the Republicans and opened a Main Street office a month before the GOP followed suit. Some think Hillary's strong showing in the primary provided the encouragement.  A tip from Beth led me to Belmont Farm on Cedar Run Road, where the only legal distiller of moonshine in Virginia operates. Corn grew along the dirt road to the farm, the same corn Chuck Miller grinds for his Kopper Kettle Whiskey, a companion brand to his Virginia Lightning, a 100-proof brew guaranteed to curl your toes. I found Chuck toasting apple wood chunks over an open fire. Later he'd drop them into a mesh bag and sink them into a vat of whiskey to add some flavor.   Chuck and his wife, Jeanette, settled on their expansive spread in 1975. Initially, he wanted to grow wine grapes, but his land flooded and the grapes did poorly, so he decided to go back to his roots. His grandfather was a bootlegger, after all, who never once got caught by the law, only by the IRS, and was forced to sell 11 houses to pay the bill for his back taxes.  Chuck is a terrific scavenger. \"You gotta be if you expect to make it in this old world,\" he said, as country music played from a couple of strategically placed radios. He takes particular pride in his pot still, manufactured in New York in 1933 when Prohibition ended. He also owns a Filabelmatic machine for slapping on labels, a relic from 1945. His whiskey barrels were Virginia oak, deliberately charred inside for yet more flavor.  The law forbids Chuck from dispensing any liquor for tasting, but I bought a bottle of Kopper Kettle on faith, and my faith was rewarded. I wondered what Chuck thought about the coming election.  \"Well, there's a lot that's the same about the candidates,\" he ventured. One, they both want to get out of Iraq. Two, they both want to fix Afghanistan. But McCain supports free enterprise, and that's good for business. Obama just wants to lower taxes.\"  Jeanette joined the debate, and she sounded fretful. \"It's so emotional this year. Chuck and his brothers just argue.\"  Steinbeck, a Democrat, had similar difficulties in 1960. \"I arrived in Monterey and the fight began. My sisters are still Republicans\u2026I can discuss politics coldly and analytically with strangers. That was not possible with my sisters.\" I understood his point.  \"Obama's a socialist,\" Chuck continued, \"and I'm not in favor of killing little babies.\" (Photo: Williams Apple Orchard. (Bill Barich))  I thanked my hosts for the tour, and took Route 522 toward Shenandoah National Park. The Indian Summer sun was hot, the air smelled of freshly mown grass, and Williams Apple Orchard completed my little slice of paradise. I passed up a bushel of Yorks for a half peck of Virginia Golds, a cross between the Albermarle Pippin and the Golden Delicious. Liz, who helps to manage the orchard, filled my bag right to the top and swore the apples would still be crisp when I got to San Francisco.

Plenty, according to Rutberg & Co., a San Francisco-based technology research firm. Venture capital investment in mobile consumer applications jumped 90 percent in the first half of 2008, to $383 million, from $202 million in the second half of 2007.  By contrast, venture investment in cell towers, networking equipment and antennas dropped $456 million to $383 million in that period. And investments in niche or regional companies seeking to compete with the likes of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint is down too, to $141 million in the first half of this year from $463 million in the second half of 2007.  There are several reasons for the shift, said Rajeev Chand, a Rutberg analyst who helped compile the data. The largest mobile virtual network operators, or MVNO's, proved to be failures last year so many investors are staying away. (One of those was Disney Mobile, which was shuttered not long after ESPN abandoned its MVNO.) Secondly, he said, as AT&T and Verizon Wireless get even bigger, there is little incentive for venture capitalists to invest in competitors.  But an equally important reason for the shift in financing is the iPhone halo effect. Mr. Chand suggested that the control wireless carriers once had over what developers could offer consumers on mobile phones is slipping, making it more desirable for venture capitalists to invest in emerging consumer applications. In the iPhone's case, AT&T does not have a say in what applications Apple makes available to consumers, a trend analysts say will be followed by other device makers.  \"The real question is what, if any, new properties come out of mobile,\" Mr. Chand said. \"If we see plenty of those, the money will follow.\"  ", "abstract": "The trend toward allowing consumers to use a wider variety of applications on their cellphones is leading to greater investment in such applications, according to a research firm.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Free the Phone, and Venture Capital Will Follow", "kicker": "Bits", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Free the Phone, and Venture Capital Will Follow", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-07-21T22:07:12+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/0c9051c4-ebe8-532a-8a22-f2dd89a84a0d", "word_count": 293, "uri": "nyt://article/0c9051c4-ebe8-532a-8a22-f2dd89a84a0d"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/technology/personaltech/02basics.html", "snippet": "Ways to run your PC more efficiently, make ecologically intelligent purchasing decisions and dispose of an old computer properly.", "lead_paragraph": "REUSABLE tote bag?

The new Apple iPhone 3G has caused headaches among buyers who are complaining about dropped calls and poor network coverage. The blogosphere is atwitter, too, wondering whether the iPhone is worth the hefty price.  Now AT&T, exclusive United States carrier for the iPhone, has two new ways for consumers to part with their hard-earned cash. On Tuesday, it announced two additional international data plans for the iPhone, one of which costs as much as the phone itself.   Heavy data users have two new options: pay $120 a month for 100 megabytes of international data use or $200 for 200 megabytes. Previously, AT&T announced a 20-megabyte plan for $25 and 50-megabyte plan for $60 plan. A word of caution: Those fees are in addition to what customers already pay to use the phone in the United States.   It's enough to make even ardent iPhone fans suffer sticker shock. But AT&T, like its competitors Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, want users to get hooked on surfing the Web or downloading maps wherever they are because customers pay more for those plans than regular voice plans.  AT&T's rationale for the fees is that it costs iPhone users traveling abroad an eye-popping $40 to download a three-minute video from YouTube (using two megabytes of data) without one of their plans.   AT&T says customers can cancel whenever they want, but there are caveats. If you are overseas for only a week, you still have to pay for the whole month -- an AT&T spokesman said the company doesn't prorate the fees. And if you forget to cancel the plan after you get home, you will continue to be charged. AT&T won't let you specify ahead of time when you want the international plan to end.

The new Apple iPhone 3G has caused headaches among buyers who are complaining about dropped calls and poor network coverage. The blogosphere is atwitter, too, wondering whether the iPhone is worth the hefty price.  Now AT&T, exclusive United States carrier for the iPhone, has two new ways for consumers to part with their hard-earned cash. On Tuesday, it announced two additional international data plans for the iPhone, one of which costs as much as the phone itself.   Heavy data users have two new options: pay $120 a month for 100 megabytes of international data use or $200 for 200 megabytes. Previously, AT&T announced a 20-megabyte plan for $25 and 50-megabyte plan for $60 plan. A word of caution: Those fees are in addition to what customers already pay to use the phone in the United States.   It's enough to make even ardent iPhone fans suffer sticker shock. But AT&T, like its competitors Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, want users to get hooked on surfing the Web or downloading maps wherever they are because customers pay more for those plans than regular voice plans.  AT&T's rationale for the fees is that it costs iPhone users traveling abroad an eye-popping $40 to download a three-minute video from YouTube (using two megabytes of data) without one of their plans.   AT&T says customers can cancel whenever they want, but there are caveats. If you are overseas for only a week, you still have to pay for the whole month -- an AT&T spokesman said the company doesn't prorate the fees. And if you forget to cancel the plan after you get home, you will continue to be charged. AT&T won't let you specify ahead of time when you want the international plan to end.

(Lerner Publishing)) The publisher of a children's book based on the fabricated love story of Herman Rosenblat, the Holocaust survivor who said he first met his wife when he was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, has canceled pending reprints of the book and will refund the price of any returned books. In a statement released late Monday, Minneapolis-based Lerner Publishing said it was \"shocked and disappointed to learn that the widely publicized Holocaust love story of Herman and Roma Rosenblat, which inspired the children's picture book 'Angel Girl,' is not entirely true.\"  \"Angel Girl,\" by Laurie Friedman, was published in September with illustrations by Ofra Omit. It told the story of how Mr. Rosenblat met his future wife when he was a prisoner and she was disguised as a Christian farm girl and tossed him apples and other food over the fence of the Schlieben camp in Germany. In the story, the protagonist meets the girl again years later on a blind date in New York.   Mr. and Mrs. Rosenblat had told versions of this story on Oprah Winfrey's show, as well in newspaper and magazine stories. Ms. Friedman had spent several days interviewing the couple. \"Based on Mr. Rosenblat's consistency and level of detail, and the long-running coverage of this story in the media, Ms. Friedman and Lerner Publishing Group had trusted the accuracy of this story,\" the publishers' statement said.   In the statement, Adam Lerner, president and publisher of Lerner, said: \"While this tragic event in world history needs to be taught to children, it is imperative that it is done so in a factual way that doesn't sacrifice veracity for emotional impact. We have been misled by the Rosenblats, who gave us and our author what we believed to be an authentic and moving account of their lives.\" ", "abstract": "A children's book based on the fabricated story of Herman Rosenblat, who said he first met his wife when he was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, has been canceled by its publisher.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "More Fallout From Fake Holocaust Story", "kicker": "ArtsBeat", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Children&#39;s Book Based on False Holocaust Account Is Canceled", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-12-30T16:17:46+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/94faf118-ef97-5f43-bce6-5b145e10641f", "word_count": 322, "uri": "nyt://article/94faf118-ef97-5f43-bce6-5b145e10641f"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/dining/reviews/05brief-002.html", "snippet": "Char No. 4 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, might have the most encyclopedic whiskey selection in the city.", "lead_paragraph": "BARS", "abstract": "Char No. 4 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, might have the most encyclopedic whiskey selection in the city.", "print_page": "10", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"rank": 0, "subtype": "popup", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2008/11/05/dining/05brief_char.650.jpg", "height": 433, "width": 650, "legacy": {}, "subType": "popup", "crop_name": "popup"}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "articleInline", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2008/11/05/dining/05brief_char.190.jpg", "height": 127, "width": 190, "legacy": {}, "subType": "articleInline", "crop_name": "articleInline"}, {"rank": 0, "subtype": "thumbnail", "caption": null, "credit": null, "type": "image", "url": "images/2008/11/05/dining/05brief_char.75.jpg", "height": 75, "width": 75, "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2008/11/05/dining/05brief_char.75.jpg", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subType": "thumbnail", "crop_name": "thumbStandard"}], "headline": {"main": "A Gastro-Bar With an Obsession", "kicker": "Dining Briefs", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Dining Briefs", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Restaurants", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Carroll Gardens (NYC)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Reviews", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2008-11-04T22:55:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Dining", "section_name": "Food", "byline": {"original": "By OLIVER SCHWANER-ALBRIGHT", "person": [{"firstname": "Oliver", "middlename": null, "lastname": "SCHWANER-ALBRIGHT", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/91def702-c3e1-52b6-bb89-f94702048708", "word_count": 295, "uri": "nyt://article/91def702-c3e1-52b6-bb89-f94702048708"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/opinion/04thu3.html", "snippet": "Anything that is good for the speed, dependability and stability of browsers has to be good for Google (and incidentally for ordinary users).", "lead_paragraph": " Google has never shied away from a computing challenge.

On Thursday, the company unveiled the Mini 9, a $349 portable computer that weighs 2.28 pounds, has an 8.9-inch screen and is tailored for Internet-centric tasks, like surfing, chatting, uploading photos, blogging, watching videos and listening to music.  Wait, aren't those the main tasks many people use their computer for? Yep, and that's why the industry should be increasingly nervous about this new category of low-cost computers.  As we've written about earlier, the emergence of a category of Internet-centric computing devices challenges the already reed-thin profit margins of the PC industry. It inches the industry away from its long-standing goal \u2013- and economic model -- of building ever-more powerful computers.  It also challenges some of the biggest American PC companies, given that the pioneers in the category are lesser-known overseas manufacturers, like Asus, the maker of the Eee PC. And it challenges some of the suppliers, like Microsoft, that are tailored for a world of powerful computers, not basic ones that function chiefly as way stations to connect consumers to the cloud.   Indeed, the base model of Dell's new machine includes a \"mini\" operating system made by Ubuntu (a $399 model has Windows XP Home). The machine does, however, use an Intel Atom chip, whereas some of the other low-cost PCs are using processors made by other manufacturers, challenging Intel's dominance of the PC platform.  The Mini 9 comes in two colors (which Dell ostentatiously, though perhaps accurately, refers to as \"Obsidian Black\" and \"Alpine White,\" showing that the PC makers are bringing their stylistic efforts to this low-price category). One wonders whether this new category will, over the long-term, challenge the PC makers in their efforts to reproduce their favorite color: U.S. Dollar Green.   One last bit: Dell's announcement about the new Mini 9 is a kind of polar opposite of an Apple product launch; in other words, the Mini 9 was a terribly kept secret. Michael Dell, the company's chief executive, was carrying around a prototype earlier this year, stoking speculation about such a product.

On Thursday, the company unveiled the Mini 9, a $349 portable computer that weighs 2.28 pounds, has an 8.9-inch screen and is tailored for Internet-centric tasks, like surfing, chatting, uploading photos, blogging, watching videos and listening to music.  Wait, aren't those the main tasks many people use their computer for? Yep, and that's why the industry should be increasingly nervous about this new category of low-cost computers.  As we've written about earlier, the emergence of a category of Internet-centric computing devices challenges the already reed-thin profit margins of the PC industry. It inches the industry away from its long-standing goal \u2013- and economic model -- of building ever-more powerful computers.  It also challenges some of the biggest American PC companies, given that the pioneers in the category are lesser-known overseas manufacturers, like Asus, the maker of the Eee PC. And it challenges some of the suppliers, like Microsoft, that are tailored for a world of powerful computers, not basic ones that function chiefly as way stations to connect consumers to the cloud.   Indeed, the base model of Dell's new machine includes a \"mini\" operating system made by Ubuntu (a $399 model has Windows XP Home). The machine does, however, use an Intel Atom chip, whereas some of the other low-cost PCs are using processors made by other manufacturers, challenging Intel's dominance of the PC platform.  The Mini 9 comes in two colors (which Dell ostentatiously, though perhaps accurately, refers to as \"Obsidian Black\" and \"Alpine White,\" showing that the PC makers are bringing their stylistic efforts to this low-price category). One wonders whether this new category will, over the long-term, challenge the PC makers in their efforts to reproduce their favorite color: U.S. Dollar Green.   One last bit: Dell's announcement about the new Mini 9 is a kind of polar opposite of an Apple product launch; in other words, the Mini 9 was a terribly kept secret. Michael Dell, the company's chief executive, was carrying around a prototype earlier this year, stoking speculation about such a product.

As head of the newly merged Sirius XM Radio, Mr. Karmazin faces the task of integrating two companies and finding hundreds of millions of dollars in cost cuts. And as DealBook recently noted, sales of new cars -- where many of the company's radios get installed -- are in a free fall. So, too, is Sirius XM's stock, which closed Wednesday just a few pennies above its 52-week low of $1.26 a share.  A marketing professor from Wharton has a few radical suggestions for Mr. Karmazin about what he should do next.   The professor, Peter Fader, said in the latest edition of Knowledge@Wharton that Sirius should get rid of its current name -- or, rather, both of them -- move away from cars and try to bill itself as a music and entertainment service.  Here's how he put it to Knowledge@Wharton:   Come up with a proposition that can compete with the iPod [...] I'm calling for a marketing makeover. Dump both names because both are tightly linked to satellite radio. The company should be saying, 'Here's a music and entertainment service that's available on every platform every place. And it's commercial free.'  These days, the air is full of unsolicited suggestions for Mr. Karmazin, who once ran CBS. Last month, he exuded confidence as he told DealBook that he was encouraged by the fact that more than half of new-car buyers were choosing to install Sirius.  But many people think that cars will not be enough.   A few weeks ago, an analyst at Citigroup expressed enthusiasm about some kind of collaboration with Apple. He wrote: \"Reports of a new Internet streaming application that would allow Sirius XM users to get content on their iPhones and other portable devices are now emerging and highlight that [the company's] value lies in its content and not its hardware or infrastructure.\"  It's not clear whether Mr. Karmazin will take any of these suggestions to heart. But Sirius XM has billions of dollars of debt that may need to be refinanced next year, so whatever he does, he may need to do it soon.

Dell has been advertising its showdown with Apple all along.", "lead_paragraph": "CLARIFICATION 5:55 p.m. - The story below references a Dell ad placed in UptownLife magazine. The online version of that ad, which has since been removed, appeared to include both an image from Dell and text. A Dell spokesman, Bob Kaufman, said that Dell was only confirming the \"Adamo by Dell\" image and not the text, which is quoted in this post.   Brett Wright, the co-founder of Uptown Media, the parent company of Uptownlife.net, has declined to comment on the Dell ad or why the text was removed.  All the speculation about Dell's coming Adamo computer appears somewhat comical once you learn that the company's confirmation of the product has been sitting in plain sight.   Last week, I spotted what looked like a blog post from the luxury magazine UptownLife, discussing a future laptop from Dell possibly thinner than Apple's MacBook Air.  \"Rumor has it that Dell is coming out with a computer called Adamo that will rival the MacBook Air,\" the blog post read. \"At press time, the company was keeping the product tightly under wraps, but PC users rejoice - word on the street is that something cool is coming your way.\"  After my Bits post about Adamo appeared, UptownLife pulled its post down, and Dell refused to discuss the exact nature of the product with reporters. This left most publications guessing about Adamo, saying it could be anything from a thin laptop to perhaps another netbook or a music player.   But it struck me as curious that UptownLife would remove its post \u2013 that is, unless the post was actually a Dell advertisement in disguise.   On Tuesday, the Dell spokesman, Mr. Kaufman, confirmed that the Adamo blurb art was in fact a Dell ad. So, it's Dell that has been talking about a product that will \"rival the MacBook Air\" all along. The UptownLife Web site just made things tricky by lumping blog posts and ads together without making any distinction between the two. (As the clarification notes, Dell is now only confirming the Adamo by Dell image and not the text discussing the rival to the MacBook Air.)  \"We did this to wake up the personal computing category and create some buzz,\" Mr. Kaufman said.   It's expected that Dell will reveal its super-thin laptop at the Consumer Electronics trade show next month in Las Vegas. Then it will be up to Dell to live up to the buzz it has created.

Usually the history-making event involves bats and bases. (I find myself rooting against the Yankees in recent years so that my kids will actually sleep in October.)   Sometimes it is the Academy awards, or the series finale of their favorite television show. This summer, the combination of Michael Phelps swimming past midnight followed by the back-to-back political conventions, meant a lot of bleary eyes at our house. And this morning we all yawned our way through breakfast. Because there was no way they were missing Barack Obama's speech.  One of the pieces of parenting that took me by surprise was the making of history. I knew I would treasure their personal stories &#151; first steps and words, milestones and discoveries. But I hadn't focused on the history being made around them as they grew, and how outside events would become part of their traditions, threads in their lifelong narratives.   I grew up on my parents' histories. My father's memories of Roosevelt's words on the radio on December 7, 1941. My mother's stories of watching in horror as Ruby shot Oswald on live television.   And I have long told my boys tales of my own. Of sitting in a hot crowded camp gym and squinting at a small black-and-white set as a man took a step onto the moon. Of writing, in careful block print, to Richard Nixon, asking him to please resign. Of glancing up at the television as I walked on a treadmill at the gym one evening and watching a wall in Germany being taken apart one chunk at a time.   Yet the fact that I was watching my sons live their own history did not really hit me until 9/11, when Evan, only 9, said somberly, \"I will be telling my grandchildren what I was doing today.\" He had the same thought a few weeks ago, when, staring at a graph of the Dow plummeting he wondered, \"will we talk about this the way our grandparents talk about the Depression?\"   Of course I let them watch last night. We piled onto the couch, covered ourselves with blankets and \"toasted\" the winner with our own election-night tradition &#151; a slice of apple pie.   I might not be around when they tell their own teenagers of the night they saw the first African-American elected President. But I will be there. That's what a family is &#151; a string of shared memories woven into an intimate history.

On Monday, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, the venture capital firm that is investing its $100 million iFund in mobile applications for the iPhone and iPod touch, unveiled iFundVC, a new blog on the iFund.   \"The purpose is to share (and hear) perspectives around the iPhone and emerging open mobile ecosystem. We've been blown away by the amount of entrepreneurial activity in mobile,\" wrote Matt Murphy, the Kleiner partner who oversees the fund. The blog will be a place for a dialogue about trends in mobile technology, and Kleiner partners and executives will contribute to it.   Laura Holson profiled Mr. Murphy in the Times last month. She reported that Mr. Murphy has been searching for mobile start-ups for seven years, but found it difficult until the iPhone came along. Everything has changed since then. The iFund has received 2,700 business plans from mobile entrepreneurs in six months, Mr. Murphy said on the blog. That is 20 times what the firm received in the similar period last year.   Kleiner, a venerable Silicon Valley firm that backed Google, Amazon.com and America Online, has invested $30 million in five mobile start-ups since March 6, when it started the fund in collaboration with Apple:   Pelago uses Whrrl to enable users to track their friends' location and share reviews of restaurants and events. Ng:moco makes iPhone games. iControl lets users monitor their homes while they are away. GOGII uses text messaging for social interaction and marketing. The fifth company, as yet unnamed, will let users access virtual worlds through their phones, Ms. Holson reported.  iPhone users are clamoring for new applications. They downloaded 60 million of them in 30 days, Mr. Murphy said on the blog -- more than were downloaded to phones by all other carriers in the United States in a quarter. That is especially dramatic considering that there are 12 million iPhone handsets compared to 250 million non-iPhones.   \"The impact of openness is now undeniable,\" Mr. Murphy wrote. \"The keys: open the mobile eco-system, solve the discovery problem, and deliver great apps ... users flock to download them.\"   Topics to watch, Mr. Murphy said: Whether and how other carriers open their application stores to developers and the more sophisticated next generation of iPhone applications in the pipeline.

Usually the history-making event involves bats and bases. (I find myself rooting against the Yankees in recent years so that my kids will actually sleep in October.)   Sometimes it is the Academy awards, or the series finale of their favorite television show. This summer, the combination of Michael Phelps swimming past midnight followed by the back-to-back political conventions, meant a lot of bleary eyes at our house. And this morning we all yawned our way through breakfast. Because there was no way they were missing Barack Obama's speech.  One of the pieces of parenting that took me by surprise was the making of history. I knew I would treasure their personal stories &#151; first steps and words, milestones and discoveries. But I hadn't focused on the history being made around them as they grew, and how outside events would become part of their traditions, threads in their lifelong narratives.   I grew up on my parents' histories. My father's memories of Roosevelt's words on the radio on December 7, 1941. My mother's stories of watching in horror as Ruby shot Oswald on live television.   And I have long told my boys tales of my own. Of sitting in a hot crowded camp gym and squinting at a small black-and-white set as a man took a step onto the moon. Of writing, in careful block print, to Richard Nixon, asking him to please resign. Of glancing up at the television as I walked on a treadmill at the gym one evening and watching a wall in Germany being taken apart one chunk at a time.   Yet the fact that I was watching my sons live their own history did not really hit me until 9/11, when Evan, only 9, said somberly, \"I will be telling my grandchildren what I was doing today.\" He had the same thought a few weeks ago, when, staring at a graph of the Dow plummeting he wondered, \"will we talk about this the way our grandparents talk about the Depression?\"   Of course I let them watch last night. We piled onto the couch, covered ourselves with blankets and \"toasted\" the winner with our own election-night tradition &#151; a slice of apple pie.   I might not be around when they tell their own teenagers of the night they saw the first African-American elected President. But I will be there. That's what a family is &#151; a string of shared memories woven into an intimate history.

Usually the history-making event involves bats and bases. (I find myself rooting against the Yankees in recent years so that my kids will actually sleep in October.)   Sometimes it is the Academy awards, or the series finale of their favorite television show. This summer, the combination of Michael Phelps swimming past midnight followed by the back-to-back political conventions, meant a lot of bleary eyes at our house. And this morning we all yawned our way through breakfast. Because there was no way they were missing Barack Obama's speech.  One of the pieces of parenting that took me by surprise was the making of history. I knew I would treasure their personal stories &#151; first steps and words, milestones and discoveries. But I hadn't focused on the history being made around them as they grew, and how outside events would become part of their traditions, threads in their lifelong narratives.   I grew up on my parents' histories. My father's memories of Roosevelt's words on the radio on December 7, 1941. My mother's stories of watching in horror as Ruby shot Oswald on live television.   And I have long told my boys tales of my own. Of sitting in a hot crowded camp gym and squinting at a small black-and-white set as a man took a step onto the moon. Of writing, in careful block print, to Richard Nixon, asking him to please resign. Of glancing up at the television as I walked on a treadmill at the gym one evening and watching a wall in Germany being taken apart one chunk at a time.   Yet the fact that I was watching my sons live their own history did not really hit me until 9/11, when Evan, only 9, said somberly, \"I will be telling my grandchildren what I was doing today.\" He had the same thought a few weeks ago, when, staring at a graph of the Dow plummeting he wondered, \"will we talk about this the way our grandparents talk about the Depression?\"   Of course I let them watch last night. We piled onto the couch, covered ourselves with blankets and \"toasted\" the winner with our own election-night tradition &#151; a slice of apple pie.   I might not be around when they tell their own teenagers of the night they saw the first African-American elected President. But I will be there. That's what a family is &#151; a string of shared memories woven into an intimate history.

(Mark Bittman)) I ate a lot of raw vegetables on this swing through France, Italy, and Spain -- some days, in fact, my stomach felt like a juicer. But when I go to markets I have to shop, and when I don't have a stove, I wind up eating uncooked beets, fennel, carrots, celery, green beans -- I love the big flat romanos -- and now even artichokes.   I didn't see really nice-looking tomatoes, though, until we got to Rome, where I bought two kinds. On the left here are some sort of big cherries/small plums; they were tender, ripe, sweet -- decent, not super-complex flavor. On the right were a kind that looked like a variety I used to grow, but found to be completely different: Nearly as hard as an apple, they had amazing intensity -- almost like tomato paste in crunchy form. I could not stop eating them. (They were, raw, better than any dish served to me at the fancy restaurant I was taken to that same night, one not worth writing about.)   They stumped me. One, I didn't know what they were; two, if they were this hard, why weren't they shipped, preferably directly to my house; three, who used them, and for what?   I was about to post a \"Help! Please!\" to Bitten, but I was also meeting Mario Batali in Spain, so I brought the remaining tomato over. He called it Genovese (though it was clearly grown in the south), and said it was a salad tomato; that Italians sliced it very, very thin, to mitigate its crunchiness; and that it was served with lettuce.   Makes sense to me, but I wish I had a case to play with. I want to see if they ever soften, and I want to cook with them. Next time.   Meanwhile, in Madrid's Mercado de Paz, a lovely neighborhood market (there are many), I encountered -- as I did last year at this time -- the quite similar Raf tomato (pictured on the right), which I believe is from Valencia (I was told the word was Valenciana in any case). Also highly prized, also fairly expensive (the equivalent of $3 or $4 a pound, which is really not all that bad, considering), also quite crunchy. Given that these experiences happened in the month of March, I was ready to move to southern Europe.   Needless to say I came home. I'll tidy up with a couple of remaining thoughts from the trip, and then back to reality. Also, stay tuned for a slide show of photos from the market.

The suit contends that he was unfairly removed from the golf team. (Photo: Rob Bennett for The New York Times))  His father made it big in politics, but Andrew Giuliani's dreams veer toward sports, he explained as he smacked golf balls on Randalls Island on Thursday. That's one reason he said he had little choice but to sue Duke University where he is a student, and its head golf coach for pushing him off the varsity golf team this spring.  Mr. Giuliani, who is 22, is the older of two children of Rudolph W. Giuliani and his former wife, Donna Hanover.  On Wednesday, the younger Giuliani filed a lawsuit [pdf] in federal court in Durham, N.C., accusing the university of bad faith by \"aggressively\" recruiting him as a high school student to play for Duke, then dashing his dreams by taking steps during his junior year in college to dislodge him from the team.   In the lawsuit, he acknowledges that he may have misbehaved in February by flipping his putter a few feet, throwing and breaking a club, gunning his engine out of a parking lot and tossing an apple at a teammate's face in a skirmish.  Rather than \"quibble\" about the details, the student said he had apologized for his own conduct, and said it pales next to the \"bizarre\" treatment he received from the school once Coach Orrin Daniel Vincent III took over the men's golf program last summer.  Taking it all in on Thursday, as the student practiced his swing before reporters and photographers at the driving range on Randalls Island, was his mother. \"It's not something you're going to be happy about,'' said Ms. Hanover, the TV personality and actress. Her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani became final in 2002, and in 2003 she married Edwin A. Oster, a high school boyfriend. (Mr. Giuliani also remarried, to Judith Nathan that same year.)  Ms. Hanover added that under no condition would Andrew be changing schools. \"Oh, he's going to finish at Duke,'' she said.  Duke, which had endured much unfavorable publicity when it suspended members of its men's lacrosse team for perceived misconduct and ultimately had to apologize, issued a brief statement that read: \"Duke's coaches and student athletes are held to the highest standards, which include a strong commitment to fairness for all participants in our sports programs. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.''  A revised and updated version of this article was published in Friday's final print edition.

It may cost you. (Barbara P. Fernandez for The New York Times))    Most people know that eating organic costs more. But according to SmartMoney.com, Thanksgiving diners may pay as much as $100 extra for an organic holiday meal.  The financial advice Web site went shopping to find out how much extra consumers have to pay to get organic versions of traditional holiday foods. Creating a shopping list for a traditional menu to serve eight people, they selected organic and nonorganic foods from a Whole Foods, Associated Supermarket and a Food Emporium, all located in New York City.  \"Overall, the organic version of our turkey-day menu for eight people \u2014 including dinner rolls, a salad and three bottles of organic wine \u2014 totaled $295.36. That puts the organic premium for the meal at $126.35, or 75 percent, compared with the same shopping list filled with nonorganic options,'' wrote SmartMoney.  Here's a sample comparing the prices of organic and nonorganic Thanksgiving foods.   Turkey (20 pounds) $99.80 vs. $23.80  Vanilla ice cream (3 quarts) $21.87 vs. $15.98  Yams (5 lbs.) $9.95 vs. $3.95  Broccoli (2 lbs.) $5.98 vs. $3.98  Heavy whipping cream (2 pints) $5.58 vs. $4.00  2 cans of pumpkin filling $5.00 vs. $3.19  1 bag cranberries $4.99 vs. $2.49     So is it worth it? Health experts are divided on whether consumers derive any real health benefits by choosing organic foods. For consumers on tight budgets who want to buy organic, the Environmental Working Group recommends a strategic approach. Choose organic foods for those products that typically have high pesticide residues, like apples, bell peppers, celery and strawberries. But for commercially-farmed products that have low pesticide levels, like avocados, onions and pineapples, you can save money by buying nonorganic varieties.  Pediatrician Dr. Alan Greene, of the popular Web site www.drgreene.com, offers an organic prescription listing the best organic items for parents to choose. Topping the list is milk and milk products. One recent United States Department of Agriculture survey found pesticides in about 30 percent of conventional milk samples and low levels in only one organic sample.

(Photos: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times))   Sustainable design is architecture's mom-and-apple-pie issue. Who could be against it?  Who would oppose the idea of buildings that heat, cool, ventilate and illuminate themselves -- providing pure air and water in the bargain -- by taking advantage of environmental forces, without depleting natural resources?  Yet in the real world, practicing architects generally cannot take the chance on untested technology. And academics typically don't have actual construction sites on which to test their sustainable ideas.  That is why the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill has joined with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to establish a collaborative practice known as the Center for Architecture Science and Ecology, or CASE.  In the city, CASE is housed in Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's office at 14 Wall Street. (Its space used to be the accounting department.) There are 24 students and six faculty members in residence. The program has been operating about a year, but is to be formally introduced Friday in a reception at the top of 7 World Trade Center. Until now, the unconventional collaboration was going through a \"shakedown cruise,\" said Carl Galioto, the Skidmore partner in charge of the technical group in New York.  \"S.O.M.'s motivation is that we want to be at the leading edge of technology,\" Mr. Galioto said. \"We don't want to wait for products to come to market.\" Conceivably, the Skidmore and Rensselaer teams will work together on developing construction methods and materials that can be put quickly to use.  (Photo: Walls in the CASE office show the variety of structural exploration taking place there.) Anna Dyson, an associate professor at Rensselaer and the director of CASE, said, \"It's really important to connect with professionals who are working with complex problems on a day-to-day basis.\"  As an example, she and Mr. Galioto cited a master planning project involving the air rights for an interstate highway in Washington, D.C. Might it be possible, if the highway is decked over, to construct \"eco-chimneys\" in which plant materials would help purify the exhaust air coming up from the tunnel-like underpass?  CASE participants will explore the use of natural dehumidifying materials, the naturally cooling properties of terra cotta walls and ways in which a structure can be modified to harness wind energy.  Though \"green design\" sometimes seems to have a flavor-of-the-month quality, Mr. Galioto said that with ever-growing demand and ever-diminishing resources, \"sustainable design will be compelling for a long time to come.\" ", "abstract": "An unconventional collaboration between architects and academics in New York is meant to make sustainable design more of a reality.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Green Buildings for the Real World", "kicker": "City Room", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Designing Green Buildings for the Real World", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-11-14T15:48:37+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/307442fd-adeb-58be-9b25-27c9385d6f2f", "word_count": 431, "uri": "nyt://article/307442fd-adeb-58be-9b25-27c9385d6f2f"}, {"web_url": "https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/are-schools-really-to-blame-for-poor-eating/", "snippet": "Cutting soda availability in schools doesn\u2019t have a measurable effect on kids\u2019 beverage habits, a new study shows.", "lead_paragraph": "Schools have been vilified for giving kids access to soda in vending machines.

(Photo: Netflix rental. (Credit: Paul Sakuma/AP)) Follow me on this, because I think there is an important clue about how technology gets adopted.   In the short term, Netflix is being hit hard by the economic slowdown. It said Monday that it added far fewer subscribers in the third quarter than it had promised investors. Its shares are down about 17 percent this week.   But the company is still an improbable success story, fending off many assaults from Blockbuster. Netflix now has 8.7 million subscribers, and its more cautious forecast is to add 278,000 to 578,000 in the fourth quarter. At worst, that's a pace of 1 million new subscribers a year -- not shabby for any business.   What I'm paying attention to is the company's still-small incursion into delivering video over the Internet. Until now, Netflix had a collection of about 10,000 older movies and TV episodes. Last week it added a catalog of 2,500 movies (mainly one to five years old) from the Starz cable network.   There is an interesting back story to that deal.   Starz and Netflix have been the two most prominent rivals trying to sell subscription services with access to movies and TV shows. That is the rough online equivalent of a pay cable channel, like HBO or, of course, Starz. It's different from the online pay-per-view model of Apple and Blockbuster's MovieLink, which compete more with DVD rental shops.   Starz's $9.95 service, called Vongo, flopped despite a lot of marketing. Since Starz, which is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, had spent a lot of money buying the Internet rights to the movies it also shows on cable, the best way to make a return on the investment was to sell the rights to Netflix. (The terms of that deal were not disclosed; typically, Netflix pays a fee to the owner of a movie every time one of its customers watches it online.)   Vongo, and so many other online movie services, have been spot-on in their vision of the future: It is very clear that ultimately we will be able to watch pretty much any program over the Internet if we want to. But it is much harder to figure out how to get from here to there, especially because of the limits on movie rights that Hollywood imposes under its existing business system.   Vongo floundered because it was too much to ask for people to pay $10 a month for a rather random and limited selection of movies.   The key idea -- and it is no surprise when you say it this way -- is that businesses can only move toward the future if they satisfy their customers at every step along the way. People with lives to lead have little interest in playing with new technology until the bugs are worked out. That means products have to be really easy to use and not have weird disappointments.  That's why Netflix has such an advantage over nearly any Internet video start-up. Its DVD business is comprehensive and satisfies customers. Customers see its current, half-baked online video service, as more of a free bonus than a disappointment. Over time, as it adds more content and improves the technology, Netflix can figure out if it needs to charge more for online video and whether it can offer an online-only service without DVDs by mail.   Netflix also increasingly has leverage because it is one of the few Internet companies that has persuaded customers to pay it a regular monthly fee. One of the biggest blocks to moving some of the best programming from cable networks to the Web is that the only viable model so far has been advertising; cable programmers are used to earning money both from ads and from a cut of the subscription fees collected by cable systems.   Netflix is already using some of its subscription revenue to acquire rights to cable programming, such as a recent deal with the Disney Channel to let customers watch shows like \"Hannah Montana.\" Over time, it could add more content, exploring whether customers find value in paying for a bundle of programs delivered online.   There is a similar dynamic that gives Netflix an interesting edge in the living room as well. The company has a partial stake in Roku, a company that has made a small $99 box that lets you watch the Netflix online videos on your television set. The company won't give out details but it says it is on track to sell hundreds of thousands of the devices this year.   Compare the proposition of a Roku box for a Netflix subscriber ($99 up front and nothing additional per month over the existing subscription) to the highly promoted video box from Vudu, which costs $299 and $3 to $6 per movie. Yes, Vudu has newer films, but its catalog is still a bit random. I just don't see how that company establishes a big base of happy customers now to get the critical mass it needs to cut deals with Hollywood.   Roku, meanwhile is now cutting deals with other content companies \u2013- including broadcast and cable network groups -- to offer other sorts of programming on its box. My point here is that without the connection to Netflix and its 8.7 million subscribers, Roku would never have been able to achieve escape velocity on its own.   I'm not saying that the big company always has the advantage. More often than not, the nimble start-up has beaten the entrenched giant. But a successful company that can build upon satisfied customers has a big advantage over a start-up without that base.   Indeed, the other serious players in online video also draw from strength in other markets. Apple is the odds-on favorite so far because of its momentum in hardware and music. Google's YouTube and Hulu are the leaders in advertising-supported Web video and may be able to add premium services as well.

(Photo: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) )  These days, the New York City subways seem to be filled with advertisements carrying prominent, unmissable public-service messages: Watch out for second-hand smoke. Call 311 if you see a homeless person who needs help. Be on the lookout for signs of child abuse. Don't harass women.   (And we're not even talking about the new, wraparound advertisements for the History Channel.)  Now the authorities have a new message for subway riders: Watch those calories.  A new public education campaign by the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene -- five advertisements, which will be posted in 1,000 subway cars -- struck a variety of themes.   One argument made is that some meals are just too big. One ad shows a plate with a chicken burrito and full toppings: tomato, guacamole and sour cream (1,170 calories). Another shows a box of fried chicken, with a biscuit, macaroni and cheese and a soda (1,210 calories). \"If this is lunch, is there room for a dinner?\" the ads ask.  Other ads suggest smaller portions. For example, getting a double cheeseburger with small fries and a diet soda (670 calories) can be a vast improvement over the same cheeseburger with large fries and regular soda (1,250 calories). The motto: \"Choose less, weigh less.\"   Another tactic used in the campaign is surprise. Who knew that a tuna sub sandwich (530 calories) was so much richer than a roast beef sub (290 calories)?   Then there is the guilt factor. One ad shows a giant apple-raisin muffin (470 calories) and declares: \"Healthy snack? Maybe not.\"   There is an online component to the ad campaign. Cathy Nonas, a dietitian who directs the Health Department's physical activity and nutrition program, will host a blog on calorie counting later this week at nyc.gov/health.  The city has taken action to ban trans fats and require restaurants to post calorie counts on their menu boards and believes that more information is better. The Health Department said in a press release:   Health Department surveys have shown that when restaurant patrons use calorie information in deciding what to order, they average nearly 100 fewer calories in each meal purchased. The Health Department estimates that posting calories on menu boards and menus will reduce the number of people who suffer from obesity by 150,000 over the next five years, preventing more than 30,000 cases of diabetes.

(Photo: Netflix rental. (Credit: Paul Sakuma/AP)) Follow me on this, because I think there is an important clue about how technology gets adopted.   In the short term, Netflix is being hit hard by the economic slowdown. It said Monday that it added far fewer subscribers in the third quarter than it had promised investors. Its shares are down about 17 percent this week.   But the company is still an improbable success story, fending off many assaults from Blockbuster. Netflix now has 8.7 million subscribers, and its more cautious forecast is to add 278,000 to 578,000 in the fourth quarter. At worst, that's a pace of 1 million new subscribers a year -- not shabby for any business.   What I'm paying attention to is the company's still-small incursion into delivering video over the Internet. Until now, Netflix had a collection of about 10,000 older movies and TV episodes. Last week it added a catalog of 2,500 movies (mainly one to five years old) from the Starz cable network.   There is an interesting back story to that deal.   Starz and Netflix have been the two most prominent rivals trying to sell subscription services with access to movies and TV shows. That is the rough online equivalent of a pay cable channel, like HBO or, of course, Starz. It's different from the online pay-per-view model of Apple and Blockbuster's MovieLink, which compete more with DVD rental shops.   Starz's $9.95 service, called Vongo, flopped despite a lot of marketing. Since Starz, which is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, had spent a lot of money buying the Internet rights to the movies it also shows on cable, the best way to make a return on the investment was to sell the rights to Netflix. (The terms of that deal were not disclosed; typically, Netflix pays a fee to the owner of a movie every time one of its customers watches it online.)   Vongo, and so many other online movie services, have been spot-on in their vision of the future: It is very clear that ultimately we will be able to watch pretty much any program over the Internet if we want to. But it is much harder to figure out how to get from here to there, especially because of the limits on movie rights that Hollywood imposes under its existing business system.   Vongo floundered because it was too much to ask for people to pay $10 a month for a rather random and limited selection of movies.   The key idea -- and it is no surprise when you say it this way -- is that businesses can only move toward the future if they satisfy their customers at every step along the way. People with lives to lead have little interest in playing with new technology until the bugs are worked out. That means products have to be really easy to use and not have weird disappointments.  That's why Netflix has such an advantage over nearly any Internet video start-up. Its DVD business is comprehensive and satisfies customers. Customers see its current, half-baked online video service, as more of a free bonus than a disappointment. Over time, as it adds more content and improves the technology, Netflix can figure out if it needs to charge more for online video and whether it can offer an online-only service without DVDs by mail.   Netflix also increasingly has leverage because it is one of the few Internet companies that has persuaded customers to pay it a regular monthly fee. One of the biggest blocks to moving some of the best programming from cable networks to the Web is that the only viable model so far has been advertising; cable programmers are used to earning money both from ads and from a cut of the subscription fees collected by cable systems.   Netflix is already using some of its subscription revenue to acquire rights to cable programming, such as a recent deal with the Disney Channel to let customers watch shows like \"Hannah Montana.\" Over time, it could add more content, exploring whether customers find value in paying for a bundle of programs delivered online.   There is a similar dynamic that gives Netflix an interesting edge in the living room as well. The company has a partial stake in Roku, a company that has made a small $99 box that lets you watch the Netflix online videos on your television set. The company won't give out details but it says it is on track to sell hundreds of thousands of the devices this year.   Compare the proposition of a Roku box for a Netflix subscriber ($99 up front and nothing additional per month over the existing subscription) to the highly promoted video box from Vudu, which costs $299 and $3 to $6 per movie. Yes, Vudu has newer films, but its catalog is still a bit random. I just don't see how that company establishes a big base of happy customers now to get the critical mass it needs to cut deals with Hollywood.   Roku, meanwhile is now cutting deals with other content companies \u2013- including broadcast and cable network groups -- to offer other sorts of programming on its box. My point here is that without the connection to Netflix and its 8.7 million subscribers, Roku would never have been able to achieve escape velocity on its own.   I'm not saying that the big company always has the advantage. More often than not, the nimble start-up has beaten the entrenched giant. But a successful company that can build upon satisfied customers has a big advantage over a start-up without that base.   Indeed, the other serious players in online video also draw from strength in other markets. Apple is the odds-on favorite so far because of its momentum in hardware and music. Google's YouTube and Hulu are the leaders in advertising-supported Web video and may be able to add premium services as well. And some cable companies, especially Comcast, are looking to extend their existing subscription businesses and relationships with Hollywood onto the Web.

The Wall Street Journal has the details:     The U.S. government reached a deal Sunday night to scrap its original $123 billion bailout of American International Group Inc. and replace it with a new $150 billion package, according to people familiar with the matter.  While the arrangement stands to considerably ease terms on the faltering insurer, it gives the government an unprecedented role as an actor in financial markets. It could also spark a political backlash, especially from congressional Democrats, because the Treasury, while adding to its AIG obligations, has thus far refused to extend a hand to the struggling Big Three auto makers.    Felix Salmon at Porfolio is amazed at \"how spectacularly incompetent A.I.G. has been when it comes to securities lending:    Securities lending is meant to be a no-risk operation. In a repo operation, the long-term owner of a stock \u2014 in this case, AIG \u2014 will sell it to someone who wants to short it, and charge them interest. They then subsequently buy back the stock at the price they sold it for; the interest is pure profit.  AIG, however, seems to have gotten spectacularly greedy. It took the proceeds from the stock sales, and instead of putting it somewhere safe, invested it in RMBS. Which are now worth 50 cents on the dollar.  This is in a way worse than AIG's misadventures in the CDS market. When AIG Financial Products wrote credit protection, it thought the chances of default were minimal. But investing $42 billion of repo collateral in RMBS? There's no good reason to do that: it's not your money, you can't afford to lose it, so you put it somewhere safe.    \"The A.I.G. case constitutes looting,\" adds Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism:    Executives there are handsomely paid, yet senior management cast a blind eye as one unit earned outsized profits while taking risks that would have driven AIG into bankruptcy were it not for the Fed's rescue. Before you say, \"Well, it was just a few bad apples,\" the biggest single job of senior management in a financial institution ought to be to assure the health and survival of the entity, which means risk management and control is top of the list (it was at Goldman when it was a private firm). Anytime a unit starts reporting very large profits, managers should be all over it like a cheap suit to make sure the earnings are not the product of massive risktaking. It only takes one aggressive trader plus inattentive management to bring down an entire firm, as Nick Leeson demonstrated with Barings.  But the worst is that not only was the initial AIG de facto bankruptcy a case of looting, the government has now decided to aid and abet AIG management in further looting.

The new unit (which he said would be a refurbished unit, but arrived obviously unopened and brand new\u2014meaning it had been returned to a store but never opened) arrived on schedule, complete with a prepaid return-shipping label for the original broken machine. All free, all covered by warranty.  I know that's not especially amazing\u2014isn't that how it's supposed to work? But to me, it's amazing that it does.   Microsoft.  When I reviewed the new Zune music players a couple of weeks ago, I needed a ZunePass subscription to test all of the features. That's where you pay $15 a month for unlimited music downloading from Microsoft's Zune store. A ZunePass makes possible a lot of the cool new features of the new Zune software, like automatic streaming from the Internet and self-updating \"channels\" of music in the styles you like.  When I went to sign up, I saw an option for a 14-day free trial. It was perfect for my review period, so I signed up.  A few days ago, my e-mail received a note that my trial period was about up, and invited me to convert the account into a paid one. The kicker: \"To avoid a possible interruption of your subscription service, please renew your subscription by Tuesday, September 30, 2008.\"  See the great part here? Unlike every other free-trial program in history, Microsoft does NOT automatically convert you into a paying customer, counting on the fact that people forget to cancel. It's an opt-in system, not opt-out. You have to make an effort to PAY, not an effort to REMEMBER to cancel. It's going to cost Microsoft money this way, but it will gain goodwill (and congratulatory posts like this one).

(Photo: Associated Press)) Detroit's beleaguered automakers suffered another blow on Tuesday \u2014 this time, to their efforts to stave off higher emissions standards for cars and trucks.  Several automakers, including DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, had sued in the Federal District Court for Rhode Island to stop that state from following California's efforts to seek greenhouse gas emissions standards that are stricter than those of the federal government. Automakers had already lost similar federal cases in Vermont and California.  Ernest C. Torres, the federal district judge in Rhode Island, ruled that the automakers had already been heard in the Vermont and California cases.  \"It is difficult to see what interest the public has in permitting the plaintiffs another bite of the apple in challenging regulations limiting the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,\" wrote Judge Torres.     Allowing yet more litigation on the matter would open the door to \"costly and vexatious multiple lawsuits, the waste of judicial resources and the risk of inconsistent decisions,\" he added.   Although Judge Torres ruled against the automakers, he did allow car dealers in Rhode Island to proceed with a similar suit.   Nonetheless, environmentalists cheered the ruling.   Continuing to file suits and appeals is \"not only pointless because they keep losing, but it's counterproductive as these guys go to Washington and beg for taxpayer dollars,\" said David Bookbinder, the chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club, which filed a brief in the case.  Melissa Hoffer, vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation, another party to the proceedings, said that several environmental groups have been urging Congress to condition the bailout on the automakers' dropping these types of suits, an argument also noted in American Lawyer's blog.  Automakers have appealed the rulings in California and Vermont, and auto dealers have filed another similar suit in a federal court in New Mexico.  Charlie Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, one of the groups bringing the Rhode Island suit, said he was pleased that the auto dealers' case was permitted to proceed.   He also said that car makers are \"committed to enhancing energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and believe the best way to do so is through a single national standard set by the federal government.\"  The ruling has no immediate impact on automakers. California currently does not have stricter tailpipe standards than the rest of the country. It would like to, but in accordance with the Clean Air Act, the state first needs a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency, and its efforts have been thwarted by the Bush administration.  Many environmentalists hope and believe that the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama will grant California the waiver. Mr. Bookbinder of the Sierra Club said that 13 other states stood ready to adopt California's stricter emissions standards, if and when they are allowed to do so.

A survey by BabyCenter, an online site for young families, found that parents will be spending 20 percent less on the kid-centric holiday this year. Of the 400 respondents to a BabyCenter survey earlier this week, 75 percent said they will be spending less on candy and 57 percent will be spending less on decorations. There will be fewer store bought costumes and Halloween parties and less adult dressing up and, did I mention, less candy?  As the daughter of an orthodontist, Halloween was a Red Letter Day on my childhood calendar. It was the only day when I was allowed to eat candy with abandon. (Well, not the sticky stuff during the years when I had my braces on. And, being ever the obedient child, I look back and marvel at the fact that I never once snuck a piece of gum or caramel behind Dad's back.)  As a parent, some of the most fun I have had with my children has been on Halloween. Our block is trick-or-treating heaven &#151; a dead end with very little traffic, where everyone knows everyone else. At Klaus and Suzanne's house there is a tent over the driveway, an array of spooky sights and sounds and a buffet of sweets. At Bruce and Carol's house there are elaborately carved pumpkins &#151; some \"vomit\" out their seedy insides; others spew flame. When my children were younger, there was something delicious about a chilly little hand tucked into mine as they clung to a their bag o' goodies with the other. Now that they are older, they are the ones handing out the candy and pretending to be scared as tiny goblins chirp \"trick or treat\" at our door.  I've never quite made my peace, though, with the fact, that all that adorableness has, as its goal, the hoarding of large stockpiles of sugar. Over the years I've started buying only candy that I don't like (no Hershey's Special Darks &#151; keep away from the Hershey's Special Darks), because that way I wouldn't be tempted by my own leftovers. And after a year or two of sucrose binges by the boys, I learned to have them dump their haul out on the kitchen table and measure out a subset of things they wanted to keep. The rest went to the hospital where my husband works, and were shared with children who were too sick to trick or treat. ( It's a counting game! And community service! And a lesson in self-control!)  I can't bring myself to become one of those people who hands out carrots and zucchinis or apples (not that most kids would be allowed to eat any of the above for fear of tampering).

In a new book, \"Closing the Innovation Gap,\" which will be in bookstores Tuesday, she writes that the valley's problems are symptomatic of a crisis in innovation facing the country as a whole.   In an interview in her Menlo Park office Thursday, Ms. Estrin said that the United States is stifling innovation by failing to take risks in sectors from academia to government to venture capital. \"I'm not generally an alarmist, but I am really, really concerned about this country,\" she said.   In her book, Ms. Estrin discusses everything from problems in elementary education to drug development, but her expertise is in information technology. Beginning in 1981, she co-founded three tech companies: Bridge Communications, Network Computing Devices and Precept Software. In 1998, Cisco acquired Precept and appointed her chief technology officer. She left in 2000 and co-founded Packet Design. She is now chief executive of JLABS.   Ms. Estrin traces Silicon Valley's troubles to the tech boom. She said that's when entrepreneurs and venture capitalists started focusing more on starting companies to turn around and sell them and less on building successful companies for the long term.   \"Starting in 1998, there was such a shift in Silicon Valley toward chasing money and short-term returns,\" she said.   Part of the reason, she said, was that Cisco and other fast-growing big companies started acquiring start-ups with innovative technologies instead of developing new ideas internally. Entrepreneurs began founding companies with the goal of selling to a big tech company, and venture investors encouraged that.   Ms. Estrin acknowledged that innovative ideas still appear all over Silicon Valley. But, she said, the technologies at the root of new products like Apple's iPod or the Facebook social networking service were actually developed several decades ago. If entrepreneurs do not continue to develop groundbreaking technology, she said, the valley would be in dire straits in another decade.

What could AOL do to make this aging page relevant today?", "lead_paragraph": "Hey, Bits readers, I need your help: Does anyone out there use AOL.com (or the home screen of the AOL software) for anything? Why? And do you want any changes from it?   I'm asking this because I got a call late last week from Bill Wilson, the AOL executive vice president for programming, who wanted to talk about the latest improvements to AOL's portal. A decade ago this would have been a big deal. AOL's home screen was the town square of the Internet, and changes were closely watched.   Now, of course, AOL's Internet access service is a shell of its former self. And AOL.com mainly serves former AOL customers who still choose to keep their AOL e-mail addresses. But Mr. Wilson claims that the site still attracts 48 million people, so AOL has an incentive to keep them as engaged as possible and to try to attract more users.   I wonder whether AOL.com is like \"The CBS Evening News\" -- an icon from another age that serves an aging and declining audience, despite regular efforts at remodeling.   Mr. Wilson isn't ready to admit defeat, and he promises big changes.  \"The portal model, although hugely successful for us and Yahoo and MSN, is an antiquated model,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"What we really wanted to do was lean into the fragmentation of the Web and make AOL.com more open and relevant to users.\"   This sounds grand, but this year's batch of improvements, which will be added to the site over several weeks, are hardly revolutionary. To my mind, the most interesting aspect is how AOL offers to aggregate some services from other companies. The mail module now will display Yahoo Mail and Google's Gmail in addition to AOL's mail. And it will also soon bring together news feeds from Facebook, Twitter and MySpace as well as AOL's own Bebo social network.   There are a few other lightweight bits of personalization, like a display of local news for people who have entered their ZIP codes. And users can add their own links to the list of AOL sections on the navigation bar.   Curiously, there is a small module at the bottom of the page that can read RSS feeds. My instinct is that this is two orders of magnitude more geeky than the typical AOL customer would want. When I asked Mr. Wilson about this, he conceded that there is only a small group of core AOL users who may want an RSS reader. But that doesn't bother him.   \"The play here is to attract a new audience,\" he said. \"This is more a move to attract an audience that may be using another RSS reader to come here and stay because there is other value.\"   So I have one more question for Bits readers, who are much more interested in discussing Apple and Microsoft than AOL these days:   If you are the sort of person who would be interested in a site that would combine your e-mail, your social network updates and your RSS feeds, would you consider using it if the name was AOL.com?

But the retail giant wants Napster\u2019s technology and nascent mobile phone business more than its main music service.", "lead_paragraph": " Amid the chaos on Wall Street Tuesday morning, another, much smaller bailout was announced: Best Buy is buying Napster, the second-place music subscription service, which has been losing money and subscribers.   The deal is almost a rounding error for a company of Best Buy's size. The stated price is $121 million. But since Napster has $67 million in cash, the effective cost to Best Buy is $54 million. That is still a good deal for Napster's shareholders because Best Buy will pay $2.65 a share, nearly double its closing price Friday.   Napster is a descendant of the Roxio music software company that bought the name and cat logo of the pioneering file sharing service that was started by Shawn Fanning and closed by the courts in 2001. Like other subscription services, it was an effort by the music industry to replicate the primary appeal of the original Napster: Listen to whatever you want whenever you want.   But the legal versions, as constructed by the music labels, have not caught on with listeners. The song downloads have digital rights management restrictions that limit what devices you can play them on. Moreover, they don't work at all on iPods, because Apple doesn't believe in subscription music.  Oh yes, they are all missing one crucial piece of the original Napster's appeal: Free. The subscription services, including the new Napster, cost about $15 a month.   Best Buy has long been interested in finding ways to sell services as well as products. It has offered a co-branded version of the Rhapsody, the leading music subscription service offered by Real Networks.   In its announcement, it is significant that Best Buy hardly mentioned music subscription. Rather, it described the company's emerging capabilities to offer services through cellphones, its technology and customer service operations. The company said it was keeping Napster's management and its Los Angeles operation.   \"We can foresee Napster acting as a platform for accelerating our growth in the emerging industry of digital entertainment, beyond music subscriptions,\" said Dave Morrish, Best Buy's executive vice president for connected digital solutions, in the company's news release.   I think the jury is out about how much retailers can profit from selling services. There is some money to be made bundling services with phones and other devices, just as personal computer makers earn something from changing the search defaults and installing trial software on their machines. But there is also a backlash from customers who don't like the clutter of all these add-ons.   I also wonder whether consumers may be less open to house brands for services than for products. You may well buy a no-name DVD player or LCD TV if it has the features you want at a price you like. But a service is a promise of continued commitment to innovation and customer care. It may be that customers will prefer well-known brands for them.   Of course, Best Buy, which has done a good job establishing its Geek Squad brand of tech support, might be able to turn Napster into a national brand of media services. But there is just as much of a chance that the acquisition will dissolve into the retail giant, and the Napster cat will die for good this time.

He leads the Silicon Valley biotech company with a \"decision-making structure that intrinsically forces authority downward to the lowest possible level providing many opportunities to exercise and test one's judgment,\" a strategic planner at Genentech wrote.   Overall, 6 of the top 10 bosses on the \"nice\" list were from Silicon Valley, including Steve Jobs of Apple, with a 90 percent approval rating; Eric E. Schmidt of Google, with 88 percent; Jen-Hsun Huang of Nvidia, with 80 percent; Shantanu Narayen of Adobe, with 79 percent; and Dan Warmenhoven of NetApp, with 78 percent.  Despite a lousy year for financial firms, two Wall Street bosses made the \"nice\" list, including Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, with an 88 percent approval rating, and Kenneth Chenault of American Express, with 80 percent approval. A.G. Lafley of Procter & Gamble and Ian Davis of McKinsey rounded out the top 10.   The worst chief executive of the year was Steve Odland of Office Depot, according to Glassdoor.com's reviewers. He had an 80 percent disapproval rating. \"Fire Odland,\" wrote a department manager. \"The corporate office in Delray Beach, FL is asleep at the wheel and frankly incompetent. Maybe if some of them would listen to or maybe even spend a few hours in a store they would understand their own business a little better.\"   Anthony LaFetra, chief of Rain Bird, an irrigation company, was second-worst, with a 75 percent disapproval rating. \"Your employees, both short and long term, are voting with their feet and exiting in a steady stream,\" wrote one employee in an open memo to management. \"In what delusional alternate universe do you exist where this level of turnover and loss of legacy knowledge is good for any company?\"   But tech companies dominated the bad-boss list, taking seven of the remaining spots in the top 10 -- hardly a badge of honor for an industry that likes to boast about its great workplace culture.   Randy Falco of AOL received a 68 percent disapproval rating, and Greg Brown of Motorola and Ron Rittenmeyer of EDS (now part of Hewlett-Packard) were close behind. Kevin W. Sharer of Amgen, Lynn R. Blodgett of Affiliated Computer Services, Jonathan Schwartz of Sun Microsystems and John Donahoe, who replaced Meg Whitman this year as the head of eBay, also made the list.   Rounding out the hall of shame was James R. Pouliot of CSAA Inter-Insurance Bureau.  Glassdoor.com went live in June 2008. It was founded and initially financed by Robert Hohman, Tim Besse and Rich Barton, all of whom came from Expedia, which Mr. Barton started.

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)) There was somewhat of a stir Tuesday from anonymous White House aides who were said to be angry with aides to President-elect Barack Obama for leaking details of his meeting with President Bush at the White House on Monday. The aides, who were quoted in the Drudge Report, cited a \"long-standing tradition\" of keeping mum about sit-downs between incoming and outgoing presidents.  Any grumbling assumes there were real \"leaks\" from Obama insiders. But beyond that, is there such a tradition of presidential omerta?   A check of newspaper clippings finds that if it ever existed, it has been broken frequently before.  For instance, after incoming President Bill Clinton met with outgoing President George H.W. Bush 16 years ago, both sides shared some of the details.  From The New York Times then:    According to accounts provided by both Mr. Clinton and by the White House, the discussion focused more on Mr. Bush's favorite subject, foreign affairs, than on Mr. Clinton's preferred turf, domestic concerns.   And when incoming President George W. Bush met with outgoing President Clinton eight years ago, Mr. Clinton did some of the briefing, himself.  From The New York Times then:   Dealing with North Korea, a topic that came up at length in the later private meeting along with Russia, China and the Middle East, Mr. Clinton told reporters: \"When I had this meeting eight years ago with the president-elect's father, he told me that the biggest problem we were facing was the nuclear program in North Korea, and we were able to build on the work they had done and put an end to that. And now the big problem there is the missile program. We may have a chance to put an end to that, and if we can, I think we should.\"   The meeting between President-elect Ronald Reagan and outgoing President Jimmy Carter was a less newsy affair, though tensions did break out between Nancy Reagan and Rosalynn Carter afterward.   From The New York Times a couple of weeks later in 1980:    Nancy Reagan has apparently patched things up with Rosalynn Carter. According to Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Reagan telephoned on Sunday to deny that she had ever expressed a desire that the Carters move out of the White House early so it could be redecorated in time for the Reagans's arrival on Jan. 20.  Mrs. Carter, who disclosed the phone call yesterday while showing reporters the White House Christmas tree, said she had assured Mrs. Reagan that she had not been bothered about the alleged remarks.     News even leaked out from the second White House meeting between outgoing President Lyndon B. Johnson and incoming President-elect Richard M. Nixon in 1968 (the first meeting was less newsy.)   From The New York Times following their second meeting in December of 1968, under the byline of R.W. Apple Jr.:   One question touched upon, according to qualified sources, was whether the Johnson administration should begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the limitation of nuclear missiles before it leaves office in 38 days.

But the retail giant wants Napster\u2019s technology and nascent mobile phone business more than its main music service.", "lead_paragraph": " Amid the chaos on Wall Street Tuesday morning, another, much smaller bailout was announced: Best Buy is buying Napster, the second-place music subscription service, which has been losing money and subscribers.   The deal is almost a rounding error for a company of Best Buy's size. The stated price is $121 million. But since Napster has $67 million in cash, the effective cost to Best Buy is $54 million. That is still a good deal for Napster's shareholders because Best Buy will pay $2.65 a share, nearly double its closing price Friday.   Napster is a descendant of the Roxio music software company that bought the name and cat logo of the pioneering file sharing service that was started by Shawn Fanning and closed by the courts in 2001. Like other subscription services, it was an effort by the music industry to replicate the primary appeal of the original Napster: Listen to whatever you want whenever you want.   But the legal versions, as constructed by the music labels, have not caught on with listeners. The song downloads have digital rights management restrictions that limit what devices you can play them on. Moreover, they don't work at all on iPods, because Apple doesn't believe in subscription music.  Oh yes, they are all missing one crucial piece of the original Napster's appeal: Free. The subscription services, including the new Napster, cost about $15 a month.   Best Buy has long been interested in finding ways to sell services as well as products. It has offered a co-branded version of the Rhapsody, the leading music subscription service offered by Real Networks.   In its announcement, it is significant that Best Buy hardly mentioned music subscription. Rather, it described the company's emerging capabilities to offer services through cellphones, its technology and customer service operations. The company said it was keeping Napster's management and its Los Angeles operation.   \"We can foresee Napster acting as a platform for accelerating our growth in the emerging industry of digital entertainment, beyond music subscriptions,\" said Dave Morrish, Best Buy's executive vice president for connected digital solutions, in the company's news release.   I think the jury is out about how much retailers can profit from selling services. There is some money to be made bundling services with phones and other devices, just as personal computer makers earn something from changing the search defaults and installing trial software on their machines. But there is also a backlash from customers who don't like the clutter of all these add-ons.   I also wonder whether consumers may be less open to house brands for services than for products. You may well buy a no-name DVD player or LCD TV if it has the features you want at a price you like. But a service is a promise of continued commitment to innovation and customer care. It may be that customers will prefer well-known brands for them.   Of course, Best Buy, which has done a good job establishing its Geek Squad brand of tech support, might be able to turn Napster into a national brand of media services. But there is just as much of a chance that the acquisition will dissolve into the retail giant, and the Napster cat will die for good this time.

Overall, 6 of the top 10 bosses on the \"nice\" list were from Silicon Valley, including Steve Jobs of Apple, with a 90 percent approval rating; Eric E.

Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, with an 88 percent approval rating, and Kenneth Chenault of American Express, with 80 percent approval. A.G. Lafley of Procter & Gamble and Ian Davis of McKinsey rounded out the top 10.   The worst chief executive of the year was Steve Odland of Office Depot, according to Glassdoor.com's reviewers. He had an 80 percent disapproval rating. \"Fire Odland,\" wrote a department manager. \"The corporate office in Delray Beach, FL is asleep at the wheel and frankly incompetent. Maybe if some of them would listen to or maybe even spend a few hours in a store they would understand their own business a little better.\"   Anthony LaFetra, chief of Rain Bird, an irrigation company, was second-worst, with a 75 percent disapproval rating. \"Your employees, both short and long term, are voting with their feet and exiting in a steady stream,\" wrote one employee in an open memo to management. \"In what delusional alternate universe do you exist where this level of turnover and loss of legacy knowledge is good for any company?\"   But tech companies dominated the bad-boss list, taking seven of the remaining spots in the top 10 -- hardly a badge of honor for an industry that likes to boast about its great workplace culture.   Randy Falco of AOL received a 68 percent disapproval rating, and Greg Brown of Motorola and Ron Rittenmeyer of EDS (now part of Hewlett-Packard) were close behind. Kevin W. Sharer of Amgen, Lynn R. Blodgett of Affiliated Computer Services, Jonathan Schwartz of Sun Microsystems and John Donahoe, who replaced Meg Whitman this year as the head of eBay, also made the list.   Rounding out the hall of shame was James R. Pouliot of CSAA Inter-Insurance Bureau.  Glassdoor.com went live in June 2008. It was founded and initially financed by Robert Hohman, Tim Besse and Rich Barton, all of whom came from Expedia, which Mr. Barton started.

The aides, who were quoted in the Drudge Report, cited a \"long-standing tradition\" of keeping mum about sit-downs between incoming and outgoing presidents.  Any grumbling assumes there were real \"leaks\" from Obama insiders. But beyond that, is there such a tradition of presidential omerta?   A check of newspaper clippings finds that if it ever existed, it has been broken frequently before.  For instance, after incoming President Bill Clinton met with outgoing President George H.W. Bush 16 years ago, both sides shared some of the details.  From The New York Times then:    According to accounts provided by both Mr. Clinton and by the White House, the discussion focused more on Mr. Bush's favorite subject, foreign affairs, than on Mr. Clinton's preferred turf, domestic concerns.   And when incoming President George W. Bush met with outgoing President Clinton eight years ago, Mr. Clinton did some of the briefing, himself.  From The New York Times then:   Dealing with North Korea, a topic that came up at length in the later private meeting along with Russia, China and the Middle East, Mr. Clinton told reporters: \"When I had this meeting eight years ago with the president-elect's father, he told me that the biggest problem we were facing was the nuclear program in North Korea, and we were able to build on the work they had done and put an end to that. And now the big problem there is the missile program. We may have a chance to put an end to that, and if we can, I think we should.\"   The meeting between President-elect Ronald Reagan and outgoing President Jimmy Carter was a less newsy affair, though tensions did break out between Nancy Reagan and Rosalynn Carter afterward.   From The New York Times a couple of weeks later in 1980:    Nancy Reagan has apparently patched things up with Rosalynn Carter. According to Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Reagan telephoned on Sunday to deny that she had ever expressed a desire that the Carters move out of the White House early so it could be redecorated in time for the Reagans's arrival on Jan. 20.  Mrs. Carter, who disclosed the phone call yesterday while showing reporters the White House Christmas tree, said she had assured Mrs. Reagan that she had not been bothered about the alleged remarks.     News even leaked out from the second White House meeting between outgoing President Lyndon B. Johnson and incoming President-elect Richard M. Nixon in 1968 (the first meeting was less newsy.)   From The New York Times following their second meeting in December of 1968, under the byline of R.W. Apple Jr.:   One question touched upon, according to qualified sources, was whether the Johnson administration should begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the limitation of nuclear missiles before it leaves office in 38 days.

But the retail giant wants Napster\u2019s technology and nascent mobile phone business more than its main music service.", "lead_paragraph": " Amid the chaos on Wall Street Tuesday morning, another, much smaller bailout was announced: Best Buy is buying Napster, the second-place music subscription service, which has been losing money and subscribers.   The deal is almost a rounding error for a company of Best Buy's size. The stated price is $121 million. But since Napster has $67 million in cash, the effective cost to Best Buy is $54 million. That is still a good deal for Napster's shareholders because Best Buy will pay $2.65 a share, nearly double its closing price Friday.   Napster is a descendant of the Roxio music software company that bought the name and cat logo of the pioneering file sharing service that was started by Shawn Fanning and closed by the courts in 2001. Like other subscription services, it was an effort by the music industry to replicate the primary appeal of the original Napster: Listen to whatever you want whenever you want.   But the legal versions, as constructed by the music labels, have not caught on with listeners. The song downloads have digital rights management restrictions that limit what devices you can play them on. Moreover, they don't work at all on iPods, because Apple doesn't believe in subscription music.  Oh yes, they are all missing one crucial piece of the original Napster's appeal: Free. The subscription services, including the new Napster, cost about $15 a month.   Best Buy has long been interested in finding ways to sell services as well as products. It has offered a co-branded version of the Rhapsody, the leading music subscription service offered by Real Networks.   In its announcement, it is significant that Best Buy hardly mentioned music subscription. Rather, it described the company's emerging capabilities to offer services through cellphones, its technology and customer service operations. The company said it was keeping Napster's management and its Los Angeles operation.   \"We can foresee Napster acting as a platform for accelerating our growth in the emerging industry of digital entertainment, beyond music subscriptions,\" said Dave Morrish, Best Buy's executive vice president for connected digital solutions, in the company's news release.   I think the jury is out about how much retailers can profit from selling services. There is some money to be made bundling services with phones and other devices, just as personal computer makers earn something from changing the search defaults and installing trial software on their machines. But there is also a backlash from customers who don't like the clutter of all these add-ons.   I also wonder whether consumers may be less open to house brands for services than for products. You may well buy a no-name DVD player or LCD TV if it has the features you want at a price you like. But a service is a promise of continued commitment to innovation and customer care. It may be that customers will prefer well-known brands for them.   Of course, Best Buy, which has done a good job establishing its Geek Squad brand of tech support, might be able to turn Napster into a national brand of media services. But there is just as much of a chance that the acquisition will dissolve into the retail giant, and the Napster cat will die for good this time.

Manhattan teacher who disappeared more than two weeks ago, was found safe in the upper waters of New York Harbor.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: Hannah E. Upp, 23, was in stable condition at a hospital on Staten Island. ) Updated, 6:11 p.m. &#124; Deckhands for a Staten Island ferry boat rescued a woman from the waters of New York's Upper Bay on Tuesday and officials later said she was 23-year-old Hannah Emily Upp, a Manhattan teacher who disappeared more than two weeks ago.  Ms. Upp was plucked from the swells, taken to shore and immediately transported to Richmond University Medical Center, on Staten Island, where officials said she was in stable condition.  \"Detectives positively identified her as Hannah Upp,\" said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.   The rescue, which unfolded shortly before noon on a warm September day, capped a saga that began when Ms. Upp disappeared on Aug. 29, the Friday before the start of the school year.  Ms. Upp is a New York City teaching fellow set to begin her second year as a Spanish instructor at the Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Harlem. Her disappearance baffled her relatives and friends, touched off a citywide search and prompted the teachers' union to offer a $10,000 reward for information (in addition to a $2,000 award from the Crime Stoppers program). Friends of Ms. Upp even set up a Facebook page, called \"We're Not Giving Upp (on Hannah),\" seeking information.   After she vanished, investigators found Ms. Upp's apartment in Hamilton Heights full of her belongings, including her keys, credit cards, wallet, cellphone and a passport. She is believed to have last withdrawn money from her bank account a day earlier.  \"It was as though she had left without taking any the things people normally would have with them,\" Mr. Browne said.  Investigators searched Ms. Upp's building and contacted every tenant. They searched the brush in the overgrown backyard as well as a nearby park, \"to make sure she was not the victim of some foul play,\" Mr. Browne said. \"We checked all the phone calls on that cellphone.\"  The police also posted fliers emblazoned with Ms. Upp's photograph.   But then -- just as mysteriously as she vanished -- Ms. Upp showed up.  Ms. Upp was seen checking her e-mail in an Apple store at Fifth Avenue and East 59th Street in Manhattan, the police said.  On a Friday evening, a classmate of Ms. Upp's at Pace University saw her in the Apple store and approached her, but she appeared to avoid him and, the police said, disappeared again. Investigators subsequently learned that someone had accessed Ms. Upp's laptop from that store, and then the police uncovered videotape from a store surveillance camera that confirmed Ms. Upp had been there. The police had her family view the videotape to try to confirm that the film showed her.  The police determined that Ms. Upp had been in the store twice within four days, and investigators began to look through her laptop to try to determine her contacts.  Things were somewhat quiet until Tuesday morning.  Then, a pilot of the ferry boat known as the John J. Marchi -- one in the fleet of commuter ferries run by the city's Department of Transportation -- saw a woman in the water as it approached the Staten Island terminal from Manhattan, officials said.  Mr. Browne said investigators believed the woman -- later identified as Ms. Upp -- had jumped from the pier into the water.     The pilot of the ferry had some deckhands launch a small rescue craft and steer it toward the woman, said Scott Gastel, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation. \"The rescue boat was lowered from the Marchi,\" Mr. Gastel said.

Sabatino, who was operating the rescue boat -- a 12-foot skiff with an outboard motor -- saw Ms. Upp, slowed the boat and grabbed her by the ankle as his partner took hold of her shoulders and back.  \"She was floating face down in the water, just like lifeless,\" said Mr. Sabatino, 28. \"She gasped desperately for air and she laid down and started crying when we got her in the boat. She had a slight shaking.\"  He added: \"I tapped her lightly to make sure she was somewhat conscious and that she could open her eyes and so we could see that she was breathing, otherwise we would have had to do medical treatment on the boat. We had no words out of her; we had no idea who she was; we just rushed her back to land.\"   When the ferry workers got to Ms. Upp's side, she was close to drowning and did not say anything, said Seth Solomonow, a spokesman for the transportation department. \"She was almost completely incapacitated when they pulled her out,\" said Mr. Solomonow. \"She was not responsive.\"  Ms. Upp was dressed in the same clothes she was said to be wearing when she went missing: a red tank top, black shorts and sneakers.   Janette Sadik-Khan, the city's transportation commissioner, said in a statement, \"The safety of passengers is the top priority for our staff at the Staten Island Ferry. Today's rescue is something that every Staten Island ferry crew member trains for, but hopes they will never actually perform. I commend the ferry crew for their heroic efforts.\"  The Transportation Department elaborated with some additional information:     The 11:30 a.m. ferry Senator John J. Marchi was en route from Manhattan about one mile from St. George Terminal on Staten Island when Capt. Chris Covella saw a figure in the water, on the right, New Jersey side of the boat. After confirming with binoculars that this was a person in the water, Captain Covella set a course for the person and alerted the crew to rescue stations. A rescue launch aboard #1 Rescue Boat (which was lowered from the Marchi), staffed by deckhands Michael Sabatino and Ephriam Washington, recovered a woman, found floating facedown, from the water. She did take a gasp and made some noise, but was otherwise unresponsive. The rescue boat went straight to shore with the woman. The total time from Capt. Covella's sighting the woman and docking at St. George was eight minutes. FDNY and EMS personnel handled it from that point. The rescue was the second for Deckhand Sabatino, who was in the rescue boat that plucked a man from the water in August 2007. Several Marine Oilers and Marine Engineers on the Marchi were involved in getting the Marchi to St. George in a safe and timely manner.   Prior to her rescue, the police were closing in on Ms. Upp. She had been seen at a Dunkin Donuts in Staten Island. Officers went there, saw a commotion at the nearby ferry terminal and \u2013 on a hunch \u2013 followed the action to the hospital. But she declined to speak to detectives, Mr. Browne said.  He said that in tracing Ms. Upp's movements, investigators found that she had visited eight different locations of New York Sports Club in the first week she was missing, \"to take showers.\" She used her own name and explained she had lost her club I.D., said Mr. Browne, but then apparently stopped visiting the clubs.   Hannah Wood, a friend of Ms. Upp's, said on Tuesday that she believed Ms. Upp's mother would be at her daughter's side. But she declined to comment further.   When the rescue occurred, the ferry boat was about a mile from docking at the pier at St. George, officials said.

Oracle, best known for its database software and related applications, showed off a pair of new server systems that should make its database run faster than ever before and give the company a leg up in the growing field for systems known as data warehouses.   \"That's right, Oracle is going into the hardware business. But we're not going alone,\" said Oracle's chief executive, Larry Ellison, speaking at the company's user conference in San Francisco.   Oracle, in fact, is not entering the hardware business in any traditional sense. Salespeople working for the software company can take orders for the new systems, but H.P. will make, deliver and service the gear \u2013- just as it has always done.   The major difference with this partnership involves Oracle's decision to champion H.P. over its other close hardware partners like Sun and Dell. In the past, Oracle may very well have struck a deal like this with Sun, as Mr. Ellison has long counted Sun's chairman, Scott McNealy, as both a personal friend and strong business ally.   Times have changed, however with H.P.'s server business growing while Sun's declines. In addition, Sun acquired MySQL, a maker of open source database software that competes with Oracle.   As far as the hardware goes, Oracle will plant its database on an H.P. server that has vast amounts of storage. By placing lots of storage close to the processors inside the server, Oracle can bolster the performance of its database software, since requests for information no longer have to travel out to external storage systems over a network.  H.P. is then combining a number of these base systems with more of its regular servers to form something Oracle is calling a Database Machine.   \"We are not talking the iPod Nano here,\" Mr. Ellison said. \"This is 1,400 times larger than Apple's largest iPod. Even your peer-to-peer network will have a hard time filling this thing up.\"  Rather than having anything to do with music, the Database Machine is aimed at data warehousing jobs. This technology helps customers such as retailers and manufactures keep track of all their inventory, sales and other business data, and it lets them search and sort this data in sophisticated ways with the hopes of learning more about the state of a company's business.   A number of start-ups, along with Microsoft and I.B.M., also compete in the data warehouse market.   Wednesday's announcement appears to be more about branding than creating something new. The H.P. hardware being used by Oracle is very much standard gear. Any customer could assemble a Database Machine on its own.   And H.P. has its own line of data warehouse systems called NeoView. It's a natural play for H.P., since its chief executive, Mark Hurd, once captained Teradata, the leading data warehouse software maker, before taking over as the H.P. boss.   Mr. Ellison largely ignored the rest of Oracle's product line during his OpenWorld speech.   \"It's weird for a software company to say hardware is the answer to the problem and not go into the software side at all,\" said China Martens, a software analyst at The 451 Group.

Upp, 23, was in stable condition at a hospital on Staten Island. ) Updated, 6:11 p.m. &#124; Deckhands for a Staten Island ferry boat rescued a woman from the waters of New York's Upper Bay on Tuesday and officials later said she was 23-year-old Hannah Emily Upp, a Manhattan teacher who disappeared more than two weeks ago.  Ms. Upp was plucked from the swells, taken to shore and immediately transported to Richmond University Medical Center, on Staten Island, where officials said she was in stable condition.  \"Detectives positively identified her as Hannah Upp,\" said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.   The rescue, which unfolded shortly before noon on a warm September day, capped a saga that began when Ms. Upp disappeared on Aug. 29, the Friday before the start of the school year.  Ms. Upp is a New York City teaching fellow set to begin her second year as a Spanish instructor at the Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Harlem. Her disappearance baffled her relatives and friends, touched off a citywide search and prompted the teachers' union to offer a $10,000 reward for information (in addition to a $2,000 award from the Crime Stoppers program). Friends of Ms. Upp even set up a Facebook page, called \"We're Not Giving Upp (on Hannah),\" seeking information.   After she vanished, investigators found Ms. Upp's apartment in Hamilton Heights full of her belongings, including her keys, credit cards, wallet, cellphone and a passport. She is believed to have last withdrawn money from her bank account a day earlier.  \"It was as though she had left without taking any the things people normally would have with them,\" Mr. Browne said.  Investigators searched Ms. Upp's building and contacted every tenant. They searched the brush in the overgrown backyard as well as a nearby park, \"to make sure she was not the victim of some foul play,\" Mr. Browne said. \"We checked all the phone calls on that cellphone.\"  The police also posted fliers emblazoned with Ms. Upp's photograph.   But then -- just as mysteriously as she vanished -- Ms. Upp showed up.  Ms. Upp was seen checking her e-mail in an Apple store at Fifth Avenue and East 59th Street in Manhattan, the police said.  On a Friday evening, a classmate of Ms. Upp's at Pace University saw her in the Apple store and approached her, but she appeared to avoid him and, the police said, disappeared again. Investigators subsequently learned that someone had accessed Ms. Upp's laptop from that store, and then the police uncovered videotape from a store surveillance camera that confirmed Ms. Upp had been there. The police had her family view the videotape to try to confirm that the film showed her.  The police determined that Ms. Upp had been in the store twice within four days, and investigators began to look through her laptop to try to determine her contacts.  Things were somewhat quiet until Tuesday morning.  Then, a pilot of the ferry boat known as the John J. Marchi -- one in the fleet of commuter ferries run by the city's Department of Transportation -- saw a woman in the water as it approached the Staten Island terminal from Manhattan, officials said.  Mr. Browne said investigators believed the woman -- later identified as Ms. Upp -- had jumped from the pier into the water.     The pilot of the ferry had some deckhands launch a small rescue craft and steer it toward the woman, said Scott Gastel, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation. \"The rescue boat was lowered from the Marchi,\" Mr. Gastel said.   Michael J. Sabatino, who was operating the rescue boat -- a 12-foot skiff with an outboard motor -- saw Ms. Upp, slowed the boat and grabbed her by the ankle as his partner took hold of her shoulders and back.  \"She was floating face down in the water, just like lifeless,\" said Mr. Sabatino, 28. \"She gasped desperately for air and she laid down and started crying when we got her in the boat. She had a slight shaking.\"  He added: \"I tapped her lightly to make sure she was somewhat conscious and that she could open her eyes and so we could see that she was breathing, otherwise we would have had to do medical treatment on the boat. We had no words out of her; we had no idea who she was; we just rushed her back to land.\"   When the ferry workers got to Ms. Upp's side, she was close to drowning and did not say anything, said Seth Solomonow, a spokesman for the transportation department. \"She was almost completely incapacitated when they pulled her out,\" said Mr. Solomonow. \"She was not responsive.\"  Ms. Upp was dressed in the same clothes she was said to be wearing when she went missing: a red tank top, black shorts and sneakers.   Janette Sadik-Khan, the city's transportation commissioner, said in a statement, \"The safety of passengers is the top priority for our staff at the Staten Island Ferry. Today's rescue is something that every Staten Island ferry crew member trains for, but hopes they will never actually perform. I commend the ferry crew for their heroic efforts.\"  The Transportation Department elaborated with some additional information:     The 11:30 a.m. ferry Senator John J. Marchi was en route from Manhattan about one mile from St. George Terminal on Staten Island when Capt. Chris Covella saw a figure in the water, on the right, New Jersey side of the boat. After confirming with binoculars that this was a person in the water, Captain Covella set a course for the person and alerted the crew to rescue stations. A rescue launch aboard #1 Rescue Boat (which was lowered from the Marchi), staffed by deckhands Michael Sabatino and Ephriam Washington, recovered a woman, found floating facedown, from the water. She did take a gasp and made some noise, but was otherwise unresponsive. The rescue boat went straight to shore with the woman. The total time from Capt. Covella's sighting the woman and docking at St. George was eight minutes. FDNY and EMS personnel handled it from that point. The rescue was the second for Deckhand Sabatino, who was in the rescue boat that plucked a man from the water in August 2007. Several Marine Oilers and Marine Engineers on the Marchi were involved in getting the Marchi to St. George in a safe and timely manner.   Prior to her rescue, the police were closing in on Ms. Upp. She had been seen at a Dunkin Donuts in Staten Island. Officers went there, saw a commotion at the nearby ferry terminal and \u2013 on a hunch \u2013 followed the action to the hospital. But she declined to speak to detectives, Mr. Browne said.  He said that in tracing Ms. Upp's movements, investigators found that she had visited eight different locations of New York Sports Club in the first week she was missing, \"to take showers.\" She used her own name and explained she had lost her club I.D., said Mr. Browne, but then apparently stopped visiting the clubs.   Hannah Wood, a friend of Ms. Upp's, said on Tuesday that she believed Ms. Upp's mother would be at her daughter's side. But she declined to comment further.   When the rescue occurred, the ferry boat was about a mile from docking at the pier at St. George, officials said.

On Tuesday, a few of those geeks started ObamaCTO.org, a Web site with advice for the C.T.O., whomever he or she might be. (Obama has said he planned to get ideas directly from voters, and he is already doing so at his transition Web site, Change.gov.)   Obama CTO was built by Front Seat, a small Seattle software company that creates Web sites for civic causes. Its biggest project is Walk Score, a site that ranks neighborhoods by how walkable they are. They got the idea to build Obama CTO around noon on Tuesday and posted it by the afternoon.   The idea came, oddly enough, from the Republicans, who are soliciting citizen ideas online at Rebuild the Party, said Matt Lerner, chief technology officer at Front Seat. He started getting involved in Democratic politics while working at Microsoft in 2004, when he founded Driving Votes to register Democratic voters in swing states.   \"Appointing a C.T.O. has been an invitation for Silicon Valley to get more involved,\" said Mr. Lerner, who co-founded EQuill, a Web development software company, and sold it to Microsoft in 2001. \"Hopefully the C.T.O., when elected, will take a look at the site and see what some of the priorities of the community will be.\"   Anyone can suggest priorities for the C.T.O. on the site, and users vote, Digg-style, for their favorites. The top idea right now, with 618 votes, is to open up government data like census stats and campaign finance data to programmers who want to build Web sites to analyze it. Others include equipping every community in the nation with broadband, building a nationwide smart grid and running the government on free, open-source software.   Mr. Lerner remembers a professor getting angry with him when he dropped out of graduate school to run a start-up. The professor lamented that when he was in school, all the best students went to Washington, but now they were going to Silicon Valley.   Mr. Lerner said he hopes the migration will change so that instead of building Facebook applications, engineers \"will go to D.C. and try to make a difference.\"   Indeed, for the first time, techies are whispering about a brain drain from Silicon Valley to Washington. In the past, \"they have felt that government is moving so slowly that it's not interesting to them,\" Mr. Lerner said. \"But with the innovation around the Obama campaign and Obama appointing a C.T.O., technologists feel they really might have a role to play in helping the government become more innovative.\"   As for who the C.T.O. should be? Mr. Lerner said he doesn't have any ideas. Apple's chief executive Steve Jobs, is his technology hero, he said (yes, Mr. Lerner did spend six years working at Microsoft.) Yet people like Mr. Jobs would not be best for the position, he said, \"because a lot of the great technologists are mavericks and innovators and might not function well in the more bureaucratic role.\" ", "abstract": "A Seattle firm has created a new site, ObamaCTO.org, for people to funnel tech policy ideas to the Obama administration.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Head East, Young Techie", "kicker": "Bits", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Go East, Young Techie", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-11-12T22:52:29+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Blogs", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Web Log", "_id": "nyt://article/b6e1a2a2-aae2-5909-8c54-3c89d1c489ff", "word_count": 579, "uri": "nyt://article/b6e1a2a2-aae2-5909-8c54-3c89d1c489ff"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-panel.4.17804853.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "Prices for the flat screens in televisions, personal computers and cellphones have plummeted in recent years, but the decline would have been even faster if not for an international price-fixing cartel, the U.S. Justice Department has said.", "abstract": "Prices for the flat screens in televisions, personal computers and cellphones have plummeted in recent years, but the decline would have been even faster if not for an international price-fixing cartel, the U.S. Justice Department has said.", "source": "International Herald Tribune", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "LG Display, Sharp and Chunghwa plead guilty to price-fixing", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "LG Display, Sharp and Chunghwa plead guilty to price-fixing", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2008-10-13T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "IHT News", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "International Business", "byline": {"original": "By Steve Lohr", "person": [{"firstname": "Steve", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Lohr", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/f1339805-c768-562e-9b6a-554968373f79", "word_count": 564, "uri": "nyt://article/f1339805-c768-562e-9b6a-554968373f79"}, {"web_url": "https://executivesuite.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/my-life-as-a-blogger-week-1/", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "The main advice I got from people who blog \u2014 as well as from people who know people who blog \u2014 is that I should be careful, lest it take over my life.

Oracle, best known for its database software and related applications, showed off a pair of new server systems that should make its database run faster than ever before and give the company a leg up in the growing field for systems known as data warehouses.   \"That's right, Oracle is going into the hardware business. But we're not going alone,\" said Oracle's chief executive, Larry Ellison, speaking at the company's user conference in San Francisco.   Oracle, in fact, is not entering the hardware business in any traditional sense. Salespeople working for the software company can take orders for the new systems, but H.P. will make, deliver and service the gear \u2013- just as it has always done.   The major difference with this partnership involves Oracle's decision to champion H.P. over its other close hardware partners like Sun and Dell. In the past, Oracle may very well have struck a deal like this with Sun, as Mr. Ellison has long counted Sun's chairman, Scott McNealy, as both a personal friend and strong business ally.   Times have changed, however with H.P.'s server business growing while Sun's declines. In addition, Sun acquired MySQL, a maker of open source database software that competes with Oracle.   As far as the hardware goes, Oracle will plant its database on an H.P. server that has vast amounts of storage. By placing lots of storage close to the processors inside the server, Oracle can bolster the performance of its database software, since requests for information no longer have to travel out to external storage systems over a network.  H.P. is then combining a number of these base systems with more of its regular servers to form something Oracle is calling a Database Machine.   \"We are not talking the iPod Nano here,\" Mr. Ellison said. \"This is 1,400 times larger than Apple's largest iPod. Even your peer-to-peer network will have a hard time filling this thing up.\"  Rather than having anything to do with music, the Database Machine is aimed at data warehousing jobs. This technology helps customers such as retailers and manufactures keep track of all their inventory, sales and other business data, and it lets them search and sort this data in sophisticated ways with the hopes of learning more about the state of a company's business.   A number of start-ups, along with Microsoft and I.B.M., also compete in the data warehouse market.   Wednesday's announcement appears to be more about branding than creating something new. The H.P. hardware being used by Oracle is very much standard gear. Any customer could assemble a Database Machine on its own.   And H.P. has its own line of data warehouse systems called NeoView. It's a natural play for H.P., since its chief executive, Mark Hurd, once captained Teradata, the leading data warehouse software maker, before taking over as the H.P. boss.   Mr. Ellison largely ignored the rest of Oracle's product line during his OpenWorld speech.   \"It's weird for a software company to say hardware is the answer to the problem and not go into the software side at all,\" said China Martens, a software analyst at The 451 Group.

Following up on those efforts, we now take a closer look at four third-party applications that can help take energy savings to the next level.   ***  (Photo: Google's widget lets you know how much energy you've saved. ) Google Energy Saver: While Apple and Yahoo refer to mini pop-up applications as widgets, Google calls its Google Energy Saver a gadget.   Whatever the nomenclature, the program requires the free Google Desktop search tool for Windows XP and Vista to use. Once installed, Google Energy Saver creates a power savings profile that adjusts a variety of power-sipping settings: lowering the WiFi adapter power, for instance, and decreasing the amount of time required to stop the hard disk from spinning.   I customized the profile to also keep the screen at full brightness while I'm working, but to fully dim it when I'm away from the computer.   Currently, the application tells me I've saved enough energy to \"toast 188 slices of bread,\" since installing it last week. I'll no doubt think of that whenever I use my toaster oven.   *    Monitor Off: This Yahoo widget is a no-brainer for Mac and Windows users who can't be bothered tweaking energy settings, but still want to conserve.   Simply put, Monitor Off switches your computer's monitor to standby mode with a click of the mouse. It's especially suited for people who haven't made the leap to an LCD display because, as the widget's description points out, \"A typical 17-inch CRT monitor consumes 80 watts electricity; putting it on standby reduces it to about 0-15 watts.\"   *  Deep Sleep: Unlike Windows, which offers both \"Sleep\" and \"Hibernate\" modes to save energy, Mac users have only one (easy) option to suspend their computers without turning them off: Sleep. Power users know that there is a way to turn on the Mac's own hibernate-like feature, but it involves typing Unix commands into the Terminal application.   An easier solution is Deep Sleep, a dashboard widget that knocks your Mac out cold just like Windows' hibernate. Unlike sleep, which continues to draw small amounts of power even though the computer appears to be off, hibernate draws no power. Instead, a file is created that remembers what you were doing and what programs you had open before the computer powered down. On rising from hibernation mode \u2014\u00a0which takes longer than emerging from sleep \u2014\u00a0that file permits you to take up where you left off.   *  (Photo: Verdiem's widget makes energy-efficient computing easy.) Edison: Windows users looking for a non-techie way to tweak their computer's energy settings will appreciate Verdiem's Edison.  Like Google's Energy Saver, Edison displays an estimate of how much energy you're saving from the settings you choose. Simple sliders let you choose to Save More, Save Less, or save somewhere in between. Options for activating energy settings during work- and non-work hours make it ideal for office computers, and the Schedule option allows weekend workers to adjust start and end timeframes as necessary.

(Photo: ) The gadget, introduced Tuesday at the TechCrunch50 conference in San Francisco, tracks your health minute-to-minute -- measuring things like calories burned and quality of sleep -- and tells you whether you've exercised or slept too little.   An avatar, such as a flower, shrinks or grows based on how healthy you've been. Eat a cheeseburger for dinner, skip the gym and go to sleep late and your flower will wilt. Eat a salad, work out and get lots of sleep and it will bloom.   \"Our primary motivation is to help everyday Americans to get up off the couch, exercise more, eat better and live a healthier life,\" said James Park, Fitbit's co-founder and chief executive.   Mr. Park came up with the idea after realizing he had become unhealthy. \"I had been working like crazy at start-ups over the last three years and really let myself go in terms of fitness,\" he said. He is a walking advertisement for the gadget -- he has lost 15 pounds over the last 10 weeks while using it.   This is the third start-up that Mr. Park and his co-founder and chief technology officer, Eric Friedman, have created together. The first failed during the dot-com bust. They sold the second, photo-sharing service Windup Labs, to CNet in 2005.   The Fitbit Tracker is a small, wireless device, the size of a thumb. It uses a motion sensor called an accelerometer, similar to that found in the Nintendo Wii, to track movement. A wireless base station collects information every time the user walks by and uploads it to a Web site, fitbit.com.   It comes in white or black and looks a bit like an Apple device, sleek and uncluttered. Users clip it to their clothing, hold it in their pockets or, as female testers have done, clip it to their bras. It tracks exercise, calories burned, steps taken, distance moved and sleep length and quality.   On the Web site, users can enter the food they have consumed to get a fuller picture of health and calorie count. Mr. Park acknowledged that entering meals and snacks can be tedious, but he said that people who are serious about losing weight seem motivated to do it. Fitbit.com includes a database of common foods and shortcuts like favorite foods and meals to simplify the process.   Users can click a button on the Fitbit Tracker to get an update on calories and exercise or check on the health of their avatar. On the Web site, a box displays their weight, body mass index, calories burned and steps walked. A graph depicts a breakdown of daily activity and levels of intensity at different times of day. Another graph shows how long it took them to fall asleep, how long they slept and how many times they woke up. A chart depicts how close they are to their pre-set goals and how many more calories they can consume or need to burn to get there. A social networking component lets users form groups with friends to compete with one another or cheer one another on.   The gadget will be available for pre-order in September and will ship early next year. It costs $99 and the Web site is free to use. Mr. Park plans to add a premium subscription feature in the future, which would charge users for personalized nutrition and fitness plans and coaching.

That quirk of culinary geography says a lot about why Barack Obama can give a public speech in Berlin without catching the kind of flak that a similar outing under the Eiffel Tower would garner.  As the Obama campaign searched for a location here for his public address before a crowd that is expected to reach at least into the tens of thousands, a great deal of attention was paid to the backdrop within the city. Little was paid to the choice of country itself.  Yet Germany is an easy call for a number of reasons. It is the site of two of America's most cherished victories, over the Nazi regime in World War II and the Soviets in the Cold War. And for the Obama campaign, comparisons to President Kennedy are always welcome as long as they do not appear too overtly sought after. Do not expect to hear Mr. Obama claim, auf deutsch, that he is a Berliner.  But a broader combination of social, historical and even demographic factors make Germany a hit for American politicians going abroad, whether it be Mr. Obama or President Bush, who in 2006 enjoyed a hearty meal of barbecued pig on a spit with Chancellor Angela Merkel.   Campaigning abroad means delving into American perceptions and stereotypes about foreign countries, even among allies. No political operative could forget the way French became pejorative shorthand for elitism against John Kerry in the 2004 campaign.  One might think that the French would have a leg up in the public-relations game, thanks to Lafayette and de Tocqueville. Yet an appearance in Germany brings few of the dangers that a campaign speech before cheering throngs in the land of pinot and foie gras might. While plenty could go wrong, and a backlash is still possible, one thing is clear: There is little danger of being labeled effete in the home of Oktoberfest and oom-pah bands.   Germany can be, well, pretty American sometimes. And often overlooked is just how German the United States really is.   As the American ambassador noted when opening the new embassy to Germany on the Fourth of July, in the 2000 census the number of Americans reporting German ancestry was nearly 43 million, the highest tally of any group. That's more than Irish or English or Italian, some five times the number claiming French roots and roughly the same number as African-American and Mexican combined.  The same debates that take place today over Latino immigrants and the Spanish language once centered around the German communities, which had their own newspapers, schools and theaters. At the peak of German migration to the United States 1.8 million came between 1880 and 1893, according to Klaus Bade, a professor at the University of Osnabr\u00fcck and founder of the Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies.   To put that in perspective, that came at a time when the population of the United States was only around 50 million, or one-sixth of what it is today. That enormous influx left a lasting influence on American culture. It was -- and still is -- particularly powerful in the heartland. The Census Bureau said that every state in the Midwest reports Germany as the largest share of ancestry, with 44 percent in North Dakota and 43 percent in Wisconsin.  The identification with German ancestry in America receded in the 20th century for a couple of reasons. First, according to Professor Bade, the wave of immigrants came to an unusually abrupt halt as Germany went from having too few jobs to too many.   The other reason is a little more obvious: Germany's place as America's enemy in two consecutive world wars.  Yet the significant American role in rebuilding and defending West Germany after the war led to what in some ways amounted to the largest exchange program in history, even if the leading edge was soldiers instead of students. That meant new contacts and even more chances for cross-pollination.  \"There are an enormous number of organic connections between Germans and Americans,\" said Jackson Janes, executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington, an independent think tank. He said that between 14 million and 16 million Americans were stationed in Germany since the 1940s, especially military families and their dependents.   The transformation of Germany from violent dictatorship to peaceful democracy stands as one of the great accomplishments in American history, a significant point of pride for the country. That may be why, even at the nadir of relations, Germany never caught the same degree of criticism as France for opposing the Iraq invasion. Though former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was against the war in Iraq, it was cheese-eating surrender monkeys, not schnitzel-eating surrender monkeys.   Senator Obama may not say, \"Ich bin ein Berliner,\" this summer, but he need have no fear diving into a few frankfurters or hamburgers at an American picnic. The meat and potato Germans, their cuisine, and a lot of their culture, is as American as apple struedel, er, pie.
