With around 7,500 commercial apple growers in 36 states, there are many apple festivals to choose from.      Apple season in North America is nearly four months long, according to the U.S. Apple Association, an industry group based in Vienna, Va.

From one angle, Boot Camp looks like a sensible effort to expand Apple's slice of the personal computer market. So far, switching from a Windows desktop to a much sleeker iMac has meant abandoning Windows for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. That means giving up some highly specialized applications for which there is no Apple equivalent. For better or worse, Apple has never quite been able to destroy the preconception that Windows belongs to business in roughly the same way that Apple belongs to the arts. An Apple computer that can run Windows will do away with such distinctions.

At dawn I rose from bed, restless, and looked  Out of my window, to wonder if there the snow  Fell outside your bedroom, and you watching.  I played my game of solitaire. The cards  Came out the same the third time through the deck.  The game was stuck. I threw the cards together,  And watched the snow that could not do but fall.  Love is like sounds, whose last reverberations  Hang on the leaves of strange trees, on mountains  As distant as the curving of the earth,  Where the snow hangs still in the middle of the air.    EXILE   Each of us waking to the window's light  Has found the curtains changed, our pictures gone;  Our furniture has vanished in the night  And left us to an unfamiliar dawn;  Even the contours of the room are strange  And everything is change.  Waking, our minds construct of memory  What figure stretched beside us, or what voice  Shouted to pull us from our luxury -  And all the mornings leaning to our choice.   To put away - both child and murderer -  The toys we played with just a month ago,  That wisdom come, and make our progress sure,  Began our exile with our lust to grow.  (Remembering a train I tore apart  Because it knew my heart.)  We move to move, and this perversity  Betrays us into loving only loss.  We seek betrayal. When we cross the sea,  It is the distance from our past we cross.   Not only from the intellectual child  Time has removed us, but unyieldingly  Cuts down the groves in which our Indians filed  And where the black of pines was mystery.  (I walked the streets of where I lived and grew,  And all the streets were new.)  The room of love is always rearranged.  Someone has torn the corner of a chair  So that the past we call upon has changed,  The scene deprived by an intruding tear.   Exiled by death from people we have known,  We are reduced again by years, and try  To call them back and clothe the barren bone,  Not to admit that people ever die.  (A boy who talked and read and grew with me  Fell from a maple tree.)  But we are still alone, who love the dead,  And always miss their action's character,  Caught in the cage of living, visited  By no faint ghosts, by no gray men that were.   In years, and in the numbering of space,  Moving away from what we grew to know,  We stray like paper blown from place to place,  Impelled by every element to go.  (I think of haying on an August day,  Forking the stacks of hay.)  We can remember trees and attitudes  That foreign landscapes do not imitate;  They grow distinct within the interludes  Of memory beneath a stranger state.   The favorite toy was banished, and our act  Was banishment of the self; then growing, we  Betrayed the girls we loved, for our love lacked  Self-knowledge of its real perversity.  (I loved her, but I told her I did not,  And grew, and then forgot.)  It was mechanical, and in our age,  That cruelty should be our way of speech;  Our movement is a single pilgrimage,  Never returning; action does not teach.   In isolation from our present love  We make her up, consulting memory,  Imagining to watch her image move  On daily avenues across a sea.  (All day I saw her daydreamed figure stand  Out of the reach of hand.)  Each door and window is a spectral frame  In which her shape is for the moment found;  Each lucky scrap of paper bears her name,  And half-heard phrases imitate its sound.  Imagining, by exile kept from fact,  We build of distance mental rock and tree,  And make of memory creative act,  Persons and worlds no waking eye can see.  (From lacking her, I built her new again,  And loved the image then.)  The manufactured country is so green  The eyes of sleep are blinded by its shine;  We spend our lust in that imagined scene  But never wake to cross its borderline.   No man can knock his human fist upon  The door built by his mind, or hear the voice  He meditated come again if gone;  We live outside the country of our choice.  (I wanted X. When X moved in with me,  I could not wait to flee.)  Our humanness betrays us to the cage  Within whose limits each is free to walk,  But where no one can hear our prayers or rage  And none of us can break the walls to talk.  Exiled by years, by death no dream conceals,  By worlds that must remain unvisited,  And by the wounds that growing never heals,  We are as solitary as the dead,  Wanting to king it in that perfect land  We make and understand.  And in this world whose pattern is unmade,  Phases of splintered light and shapeless sand,  We shatter through our motions and evade  Whatever hand might reach and touch our hand.  Newdigate Prize, Oxford, 1953    WE'VE COME TO EXPECT   We've come to expect earthquakes, fires, hurricanes,  and tidal waves from our whitecoated brothers  whose laboratories shed radiation  on land and landscape,   disabling cities. Foresighted citizens  outfit granite arks in Idaho's brown hills,  stocked against flood, famine, pestilence, war, and  hunger of neighbors,   with bulgur, freeze-dried Stroganoff, and Uzis.  Let's remember: Our great-grandfathers holed up  in mountains with pistols and pemmican, their  manhood sufficient,   should they avoid peritonitis and gangrene,  to perform the mechanic alchemy  which liquefied landscape, dirt to nuggets, and  sluiced a state golden.   Let's remember not only the local wars  over claims but a late conflict of siblings  in aristocracy and the stock market,  sharing destruction.   Or recollect the brothers who stayed back east  laboring in the shoe factory, or their  bosses who summered hunting in Scotland and  reside forever   in the Protestant Cemetery at Rome  among cats, the pyramid of Cestius,  and Keats's grave. What use are those forefathers  to our condition?   We want comfort: Shall we consult Jefferson?  Alas, he's busy conducting a call-in  show for Republican-Democrats. Franklin?  He is occupied   obliterating SIN from Webster's project.  If we approach doddering George Washington,  he only smiles at us in his foolishness.  Shall we call upon   Abraham Lincoln for succor? No: The Great  Emancipator succumbs to Grant's whiskey.  As we approach the present, passing double  Roosevelts, we do   not help ourselves - not with old Eisenhower  cursing at caddies; not with Nixon cursing.  But if we return past Jonathan Edwards,  past Cotton Mather,   to the Israelites of the Mayflower -  who make covenant with Jehovah's promised  wilderness and the manna of Indian  corn, who stay secure   in Adam's fall and the broken promises  of the remnant - we discover ancestors  appropriate to our lapsarian state:  Their rage sustains us    THE PAINTED BED   \"Even when I danced erect  by the Nile's garden  I constructed Necropolis.  \"Ten million fellaheen cells  of my body floated stones  to establish a white museum.\"  Grisly, foul, and terrific  is the speech of bones,  thighs and arms slackened  into desiccated sacs of flesh  hanging from an armature  where muscle was, and fat.  \"I lie on the painted bed  diminishing, concentrated  on the journey I undertake  to repose without pain  in the palace of darkness,  my body beside your body.\"    SECRETS   You climbed Hawk's Crag, a cellphone in your baggy shorts,  and gazed into the leafing trees and famous blue water.  You telephoned, in love with the skin of the world. I heard you  puff as you started to climb down, still talking, switching  your phone from hand to hand as the stone holds required.  You sang show tunes sitting above me, clicking your fingers,  swaying your shadowy torso. We attended to each other  in a sensuous dazzle as global as suffering  until gradual gathering spilled like water over the stone dam  and we soared level across the long-lived lake.   But how  can one flesh and consciousness adhere to another,  knowing that every adherence ends in separation? I longed  for your return, your face lit by a candle, your smile  private as a kore's under an inconstant flame - and dreamt  I stared into the flat and black of water, afraid to drown.   It is half a year since we slept beside each other all night.  I wake hollow as a thighbone with its marrow picked out.  In falling snow, a crow pecks under the empty birdfeeder.   When the house lights go out in wind and heavy snow,  the afternoon already black, I lie frightened in darkness  on the unsheeted bed. No one comes to my door.  Old age concludes in making wills and trusts and inventories,  in knees that buckle going downstairs. Wretched in airless  solitude, I want to call you,  but if you hear my voice  you will unplug your telephone and lie awake until morning.   I remember you striding toward me, hands in jean pockets,  each step decisive, smiling as if you knew that the cool  air kept a secret, but might be cajoled into revealing it.

ECONOMIC MEASUREMENTS -- Few if any fireworks are expected from the coming crop of economic reports, but expectations can always be wrong. Leading off the week will be the Federal Reserve's consumer credit report for June (Monday), followed by second-quarter productivity figures (Tuesday), wholesale trade data for June (Wednesday), trade deficit figures for June (Thursday) and, on Friday, import prices for July, retail sales for July and business inventories for June.    CORE CONSTITUENCY -- The annual worldwide developers conference of Apple Computer will be held all week, starting Monday, in San Francisco. Apple calls it its ''most important annual event for hardware and software developers, including in-house developers, computational scientists, I.T. managers and system administrators.'' But given the disclosure last week that the company had found new irregularities in its handling of stock options and that it would be revising some financial statements, code writers will probably not be the only ones waiting eagerly to hear what Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, has to say.    A PENNY EARNED -- Earnings reports are starting to wind down, but there are still some big names reporting this week. The highlights include: Priceline.com (Monday); Cablevision Systems, Cisco Systems and the News Corporation (Tuesday); Aramark, Cendant, the Interpublic Group of Companies, Viacom and Walt Disney (Wednesday); and Expedia, J.

A1    Easier North Korean Defections  The increasing ease with which people can buy their way out of North Korea suggests that the state's ability to control its citizens is diminishing, according to defectors and other experts on the subject.   A1    Japan assured Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it had no intention of pursuing a nuclear weapons program, despite North Korea's detonation of a nuclear device.   A14    Israel Finds Smuggling Tunnels  Israeli troops uncovered what they said were five smuggling tunnels as they advanced along the Gaza Strip's southern border with Egypt, and four Palestinians were killed in clashes, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian security officials.   A6    Sri Lankan Town Attacked  Powerful explosions rocked an important southern tourist town in Sri Lanka for the first time, apparently extending the war to a stronghold of the Sinhalese majority.   A3    Almost two years after a tsunami ravaged villages along the coast, a resurrection of violence in Sri Lanka's ethnic war has all but stopped foreign-financed reconstruction in some of the hardest hit areas.

A5    NATIONAL A16-24    Unlike the Democrats, G.O.P. Plays Down Iraq  With three weeks left until Election Day, Republican candidates are barely mentioning Iraq on the campaign trail and in their television advertisements. It is the Democrats who have seized on Iraq as a central election issue.  A1    As dozens of states are enforcing new voter registration laws and switching to paperless electronic voting systems, officials across the country are bracing for a chaotic Election Day with long lines, heightened confusion and an increase in the number of contested results.  A1    Arizona Crackdown Challenged  In a campaign to choke off payments to smugglers, the Arizona attorney general has periodically obtained warrants to seize money transferred by wire into Arizona from 29 other states. But the program has come under legal attack.  A24    According to a new report about immigrants' money transfers to Latin America, money flows from almost every state.

Booker's dream of turning Newark into the paragon of American cities sounded good in campaign speeches, but after 100 days in office, the ambitious young mayor is starting to settle for a city that is a little less bruised, as he has come to find running New Jersey's largest city more challenging than he ever expected.  A1    Putting Off Kindergarten  Many New York parents are keeping their children out of kindergarten until they are nearly, or already, 6 years old believing the notion that an extra year of preschool builds a child's confidence and abilities. Yet research on whether the extra year helps is inconclusive.

Do you have any suggestions for individuals and small businesses to combat spam?    A. Small businesses can have just as much unsolicited junk mail clogging their mail servers as do larger corporations, but often lack the human and software resources of the bigger companies to fight it as effectively. But there are some options for fighting back.     Many Internet service providers or companies like Yahoo that host small-business Web sites and mail servers offer spam filtering at the server level, so you may want to check with your I.S.P. to see what's available. Providers like America Online and EarthLink already filter spam for individual e-mail accounts.

A1    The hanging ended the life of one of the most brutal tyrants in recent history. An obituary.  A10    Under heavy American pressure, the Iraqi government ordered two Iranians who had been detained in an American military raid to leave the country, Iraqi officials said, ending a bitter, nine-day political standoff.  A9    Young Africans Pack Schools  After two decades of sluggish growth in enrollment rates, sub-Saharan Africa's 45 countries find themselves with nearly 22 million more students who flooded their classrooms between 1999 and 2004. A1    Anti-Ethiopia Riots in Somalia  Anti-Ethiopia riots erupted in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, while masked gunmen emerged for the first time on the streets, a day after Ethiopian-backed troops captured the city from Islamist forces.  A4    Anorexia Debate in Brazil  In less than two months, four young women have died in widely publicized cases of anorexia in Brazil, causing a national debate about body image and eating disorders in a country where eliminating hunger among the millions of poor has traditionally been an important cause. A4    Belarus Challenges Its Big Ally  For Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, 2006 is ending as it began: in a dispute over prices and control of a pipeline in a neighboring country that is threatening the flow of natural gas to Europe. But this time, the price increase was levied on a Russian ally, Belarus.  A5    NATIONAL A12-16    Plan to Bolster Security In Harbors Falls Short  A Coast Guard plan to combat terrorism by creating the equivalent of an air traffic control system in the coastal waters off Miami, a test for a nationwide effort, has fallen far short of expectations.   A14    For Families, Costly Care  Families have always looked after their elderly loved ones. But never before in history has old age lasted so long or been so costly, compromising the retirement of baby boomers who were expecting inheritances rather than the shock of depleted savings.   A1    A Ray of Hope for Diabetics  There are at least 21 million diabetics in the United States, and health officials have begun to despair of combating the disease. But amid this gloom, a public health experiment in Asheville, N.C., is something of a ray of hope, an example of the battle that can win results and save lives in the face of a disease that has resisted quick-fix solutions.  A1    Private Service for the Fords  The first day of public mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford began in Palm Desert, Calif., much the way his post-White House life did here 30 years ago -- privately, absent of pomp, a small-town affair writ large by history more than family intent.   A13    Second Storm Hits Colorado  With the second of two snowstorms in back-to-back weeks swirling through Colorado, city officials and holiday travelers were finding coping with the second one incrementally easier.   A12    Pentagon Seeks More Money  The Pentagon is seeking nearly $100 billion for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, a request that would set an annual record for war-related spending.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION B1-7    Expensive and Unused, Security Doors Written Off  Nineteen technologically advanced security doors that New York City bought for nearly $1 million have spent five years inside a Rikers Island warehouse and will soon be headed for secret destinations in countries that are American allies in the war on terror. The doors are being given away after three failed attempts to auction them off. B1    Debit Card Helps Immigrants  New Labor, a nonprofit workers center in New Brunswick, N.J., is giving special debit cards to hundreds of immigrants who do not have checking accounts or credit cards and often face high check-cashing fees and frustrating obstacles in paying bills. B1    Religion Journal  B7    Neediest Cases  B2    SPORTSSATURDAY D1-8    Weiss Denies Link to Giants  Notre Dame's football coach Charlie Weis called his connection to a possible opening with the New York Giants ''ridiculous'' during a news conference in New Orleans. His strong language does not keep Weis from topping lists of potential replacements for Giants Coach Tom Coughlin, whose job is in jeopardy.  D1    OBITUARIES A17    Fernand Nault  One of Canada's foremost dance figures, who followed up a 21-year career at American Ballet Theater with artistic leadership of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and with prolific choreography that ranged from ''The Nutcracker'' to ''Tommy,'' his 1970 hit rock ballet, he was 85, one day short of his 86th birthday.

[Page C1.]    CARTOONS ON THE CELLPHONE -- ''Lil' Bush,'' a cartoon show about the adventures of a grade-school version of President Bush and his pals made its debut on Amp'd cellphones on Sept. 1. Six five-minute episodes are to be released every week for six weeks, and each is to be available on demand afterward. The series is another example of cellphone service companies looking to attract subscribers -- and draw more money out of existing ones -- with original content, especially video. [C5.]    SHOWTIME AT APPLE -- On Tuesday, Apple will hold another of Steven P. Jobs's marketing events to unveil what is expected to be his next campaign: to transform the distribution of movies as thoroughly as he has revolutionized the recording industry with iTunes.

Like MySpace, the sites are designed for browsing and blogging, with some shopping-related technology twists included. ''Online shopping is more accurately described as purchasing, because it's so directed and goal-specific,'' said Gordon Gould, ThisNext's chief executive, left. E-Commerce Report, Bob Tedeschi. [C6.]    THE PRETEXT MASQUERADE -- At the heart of the controversy swirling around Hewlett-Packard is the technique known as pretexting -- obtaining the calling records of people under a pretext, like masquerading as a customer. The shady subculture of pretexting has been getting renewed attention since it came to light last week that a subcontractor for an investigative firm working for H.P. used pretexting to obtain the call records of company directors and reporters. [C1.]    FOR OPEC, PRICE CONCERNS -- What a difference a few weeks can make. As OPEC ministers prepare to meet today, the major question on delegates' minds is not how high oil prices will rise, but just how far they might drop. Crude oil prices have fallen more than $10 a barrel in the last month, driving down the retail price of gasoline and providing some relief for consumers. [C1.]    REGIONAL NEWS AND LAYOFFS -- On Thursday, The Dallas Morning News is expected to announce that more than 100 newsroom staffers have accepted buyout packages, shrinking the size of the staff by slightly less than 20 percent. As a result, what was once a newspaper with national reach will focus mainly on local and regional news.

TOWARD A BETTER CANAL -- Panamanians will vote in a referendum over whether to add a third set of locks to the Panama Canal (Sunday). The country took over the canal from the United States in 1999, and although there seems to be broad agreement that the project would help bring the outdated canal up to modern standards -- making room for larger ships, for instance, and cutting wait times for vessels lingering offshore -- many Panamanians are skeptical. There is concern, among other things, that the government's $5.2 billion price tag for the seven-year project is a low estimate. Meanwhile, Nicaragua's president has proposed spending $18 billion to build a wider alternative to the Panama Canal.    INDICATORS DU JOUR -- For economic indicators, the focus this week will be on inflation, with the release of the Producer Price Index for September (Tuesday) and the Consumer Price Index for September (Wednesday).

His plan is to fill the pages of Time with more essays and news analysis, give the magazine a sharper point of view and draw more brand-name journalists into the fold.

[Page C1.]    A WIKI WAVE -- Although Wikipedia is operated by a nonprofit foundation, ideas for advertising-based wiki sites are beginning to take their place alongside blogs and social networking sites as a staple of Silicon Valley business plans. [C1.]    GIRLS AS GAMERS -- The Frag Dolls, a group of stylish, fresh-faced girls, are one of the latest weapons in the gaming industry's effort to smash the stereotypical image of the gamer as a geeky teenage boy battling aliens. The French computer game giant Ubisoft is backing teams of girl game players while the girls help Ubisoft promote computer play. Other companies are also intensifying efforts to tap the feminine side of computers in a $29 billion industry that is trying to cope with declining sales as consumers await the arrival of a new generation of consoles. [C2.]    A REVIVAL OF SORTS -- Vonage went public in May at $17 and bottomed out at $6.30 in July, but since then the stock has stabilized and climbed slightly. It closed on Friday at $8.90. Today, the company plans to announce that it has attained 2 million subscribers, up from 1.6 million at the end of the first quarter. [C1.]    A MESSAGE IN LEBANON -- A billboard for Johnnie Walker whiskey stretches across the side of a multistory building north of Beruit and shows a drawing of a bridge with a chunk missing. In an allusion to the Israeli air strikes, the Johnnie Walker character, cane in hand, strides away from the gap and across the bridge on the poster, which urges the Lebanese to ''keep walking.'' The ad is notable because multinational companies usually go out of their way to insulate their marketing from any reference to sensitive international disputes. [C4.]    ASSESSING A PRODUCT -- Scores of Internet merchants have begun following Amazon's lead by posting customer reviews -- both flattering and flaming -- of products they sell, and directing shoppers to sources of the most highly rated items. At Petco, for example, the Web division has tested the service of a new technology that essentially polls retail customers. According to John Lazarchic, Petco's vice president for e-commerce, left, 30 days after the company placed links near products asking visitors to write reviews, more than 1,000 products attracted comments. Bob Tedeschi, E-Commerce Report [C5.]    BLOG SITE SHUTDOWN -- Lee Siegel, a senior editor for The New Republic and the author of the Lee Siegel on Culture blog, was suspended indefinitely from the magazine after a reader accused him of using a ''sock puppet,'' or Internet alias, to attack his critics in the comments section of his own blog. An editor's apology replaced the blog on the Web site. [C4.]    TAKING ON ITUNES -- So far, none of the companies that sell music online have emerged as serious competitors to Apple iTunes. But not one has an audience like MySpace, which announced plans to begin selling songs. For the industry, which worries about Apple's online dominance, a MySpace music store could present a difficult decision. News Analysis. [C3.]    THE LIFE OF CONRAD BLACK -- According to a Canadian newspaper report, a recent court order stipulates that Conrad M. Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, can each spend up to $25,000 a month on ''reasonable'' expenses, which must be approved by the court. For Lord Black, that is budget living. In a financial disclosure, Lord Black said his monthly expenses ran more in the range of $200,000, and that was after selling his homes in London and New York. The asset freeze is yet another major obstacle for the former press tycoon, who is at the center of a web of corporate scandal and is preparing to defend himself against criminal fraud and racketeering charges.

Behind the News -- The vote was the last real hurdle in a decades-long quest for a new stadium. The Yankees at one point threatened to move the team to New Jersey, and more recently Manhattan had been in the running. But in the end the team opted for a site next to the existing stadium in the South Bronx. The Council went along, over objections from neighborhood residents that the project would usurp parkland.    SILICON VALLEY    The News -- Apple Computer said it would introduce software to enable its Macintosh computers to run the Microsoft Windows operating system as well as its own.    Behind the News -- For Apple, which had long ignored and even mocked Microsoft's product, the decision was nothing short of revolutionary. But it was based on a simple business calculus: limiting its computers to a single operating system had limited the company's growth. If Macintoshes can run the vast array of Windows-only software, Apple may grab more than its current 5 percent share of the PC market.    WASHINGTON    The News -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lobbied Congress to support the administration's effort to aid India's nuclear power program.    Behind the News -- Legislators had criticized the deal, citing concerns over India's nuclear weapons program. Ms. Rice sought to reassure the critics, saying she would push India to safeguard its civilian plants and block exports of weapons-making material. The calming words had an effect: several lawmakers offered qualified support for the agreement, leaving the White House optimistic that it would be approved.    ISRAEL    The News -- The Kadima Party, the winner in Israeli elections last month, said it would form a coalition with the Labor Party.    Behind the News -- The announcement does not quite settle the issue of what the new government will look like, as two or three smaller parties will be needed to form a parliamentary majority. But it goes a long way toward ensuring the continuation of the policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who is incapacitated by a coma. The parties agree on critical policy, including the removal of more Israeli settlements from the West Bank.    TV LAND    The News -- Katie Couric, a fixture on NBC's ''Today'' for 15 years, will join CBS, where she will anchor the evening newscast.    Behind the News -- For CBS, which courted Ms. Couric for a year, the move is an effort to attract new viewers to its newscast, a ratings also-ran in recent years. The hope is that some of her legions of fans who have made ''Today'' a ratings hit will start watching her at night. CBS may also be thinking that ''Today'' may stumble without her, creating an opening for the network's morning show, which is even more of a ratings laggard.", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Play Ball! | April 2-8", "kicker": "THE WEEK", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THE WEEK; Play Ball! | April 2-8", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-04-09T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Week in Review Desk", "section_name": "Week in Review", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/18e5a15f-fe15-5a77-a2f1-8e3537de0d82", "word_count": 506, "uri": "nyt://article/18e5a15f-fe15-5a77-a2f1-8e3537de0d82"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/17ctqbite.html", "snippet": "Three years ago, new ownership turned The Good Food Store, which offered all kinds of food and culinary accessories, into Good Food Good Things.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.63 points, to finish at 1,311.56. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 14.39 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 2,359.75.

[C1.]    Coca-Cola Announces Unusual Pay Plan for Directors  The Coca-Cola Company announced an unusual plan for paying outside directors: If earnings per share do not rise fast enough over a three-year period, directors will get nothing. But they will get a raise from what they used to get if earnings do perform as expected. While many companies pay directors all or part of their pay in stock or stock options, Coca-Cola appears to be the first to have adopted a plan that will pay directors nothing if the company does not perform well. Market Place. [C1.]    Couric Confirms That She Will Move to CBS  Katie Couric announced that she would leave her job as co-host of NBC's ''Today'' show, a job she has held for 15 years, to take the riskier but historically significant step of becoming the anchor of the ''CBS Evening News.'' [A1.]    As Katie Couric prepares to ascend to anchor of the ''CBS Evening News,'' she will be moving into a world that for several years has emphasized softer features. Still, some people in the business agree that it will be her ability to direct and deliver so-called hard news that will determine whether she is able to move CBS from its longtime spot in last place among the three network newscasts and to attract younger viewers. [C1.]    Media buyers are asking: When Katie Couric jumps to the ''CBS Evening News,'' will advertising dollars follow? [C5.]    In Massachusetts, a Rare Consensus on Health Care  Massachusetts has more than its share of political egos per capita, so one of the most surprising things about this week's legislation creating near-universal health care coverage is that it involved the cooperation of virtually every political stakeholder in the state.

[C13.]    Chinese Officials Plan to Show Buying Prowess in U.S.  Chinese leaders, eager to improve relations with the United States ahead of a visit by President Hu Jintao this month, have dispatched a large delegation of business and economic officials to display China's buying power and to cool protectionist sentiment in Congress. [A8.]    Thales of France to Acquire Alcatel Units  Thales, the French military contractor and electronics company, said that it had agreed to buy satellite and security businesses from Alcatel for cash and stock worth about 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to keep the operations in French hands. The deal comes days after Alcatel agreed to buy Lucent Technologies of New Jersey. [C6.]    Poland Reaches Deal With Italian Bank  Breaking an impasse that had stained its image and put it on a collision course with the European Union, the Polish government reached an agreement with the giant Italian bank UniCredito that allows two Polish banks to be combined under their Italian ownership. Under the deal, UniCredito agreed to sell 200 of the 480 branches of Bank BPH, the big Polish financial institution it acquired last year through its purchase of the HVB Group of Germany.

Behind the News -- The bans were instituted after an advocacy group announced the results of studies showing the beverages contained on average more than 24 times the safe limits of pesticides. Coca-Cola and Pepsi say their products are safe. But the companies are generally perceived as having bungled their response to the crisis, misjudging how quickly politicians would latch on to the advocacy group's report, playing to widespread wariness of multinationals.    HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS    The News -- Federal researchers concluded that only a contact-lens solution made by Bausch & Lomb contributed to an outbreak of fungal eye infections earlier this year.    Behind the News -- The company had argued that customers who failed to clean their lenses properly were largely at fault. But the report pointed the finger at Bausch & Lomb's ReNu With MoistureLoc. A total recall of the product last spring has been effective; the number of new infections is near zero. But the recall has affected the company's bottom line: it announced profits would be down 78 percent this year.    COMPUTERS    The News -- A top executive of AOL resigned after the disclosure that the company had released information about Web searches by 650,000 customers.    Behind the News -- The chief technology officer, Maureen Govern, was deemed ultimately responsible for the release; two employees under her were fired. The company said it would tighten data-privacy rules and retrain employees. But online privacy advocates said AOL's moves weren't enough, and warned that the problems of keeping data confidential were endemic to the search-engine industry.    ONLINE SERVICES    The News -- Apple said it was recalling nearly two million laptop batteries, saying they posed a fire hazard.    Behind the News -- The announcement came just a week after Dell said it would recall about four million batteries for the same reason. Together they constitute by far the largest recall in the consumer electronics industry. For Sony, which made the batteries involved in both recalls, it was more bad news. The company's reputation for innovative design has suffered in recent years; now its reputation for quality has taken a hit, too.    MOVIES    The News -- Paramount ended its 14-year relationship with Tom Cruise, saying the actor's recent conduct had been unacceptable.    Behind the News -- Mr. Cruise's people insisted he had not been fired but had quit. The dispute quickly escalated, with many agents, producers and other impresarios choosing sides. While Mr. Cruise's behavior -- which included remarks against psychiatry and in favor of Scientology -- was at issue, this being Hollywood, so was money. The weak opening take of his latest film convinced many Paramount executives that Mr. Cruise was becoming an albatross.", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Liabilities | Aug. 20-26", "kicker": "THE WEEK", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THE WEEK; Liabilities | Aug. 20-26", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-08-27T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Week in Review Desk", "section_name": "Week in Review", "byline": {"original": null, "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/2220ad2f-554c-5db4-a67e-ac3dc58e8a48", "word_count": 480, "uri": "nyt://article/2220ad2f-554c-5db4-a67e-ac3dc58e8a48"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/nyregion/13bomb.html", "snippet": "New York City counterterrorism detectives, using a Brooklyn mailbox and a self-storage room in the Bronx, gathered enough ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to build a 1.3-ton truck bomb, officials said.", "lead_paragraph": "Two years ago, six New York City counterterrorism detectives, using a Brooklyn mailbox and a self-storage room in the Bronx, gathered enough ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to build a 1.3-ton truck bomb, officials said yesterday.", "abstract": "New York City counterterrorism detectives, using a Brooklyn mailbox and a self-storage room in the Bronx, gathered enough ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to build a 1.3-ton truck bomb, officials said.", "print_page": "4", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Test Shows Ease of Buying Bomb Parts", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Test Shows Ease of Buying Bomb Parts", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Bombs and Explosives", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "New York City", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Homeland Security Department", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2006-09-13T04:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metro", "section_name": "New York", "byline": {"original": "By Al Baker", "person": [{"firstname": "Al", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Baker", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/7c30f208-92ae-5d74-b7ba-48358fca8e3c", "word_count": 520, "uri": "nyt://article/7c30f208-92ae-5d74-b7ba-48358fca8e3c"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/business/worldbusiness/burden-of-the-years-weighs-on-windows.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "", "abstract": "", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Burden of the years weighs on Windows", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Burden of the years weighs on Windows", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "2006-03-26T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Business Day", "subsection_name": "International Business", "byline": {"original": "By Steve Lohr and John Markoff", "person": [{"firstname": "Steve", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Lohr", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}, {"firstname": "John", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Markoff", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 2}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/a01fdf36-e55e-534f-b5aa-0c195b8a9661", "word_count": 688, "uri": "nyt://article/a01fdf36-e55e-534f-b5aa-0c195b8a9661"}, {"web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/technology/poguesposts/01pogues-posts.html", "snippet": "One drawback of buying music online is that you don't get the little booklet that would have accompanied the physical CD.

Otellini, introduced Apple's first Macintosh computers that use processing chips from Intel.    Behind the News -- The shift came several months ahead of schedule, and surprised analysts. It was only last spring that Apple said it would stop using I.B.M. processors, a decision that shook up the semiconductor industry. The move to Intel chips was also something of a shock, since Intel has long been an ally of Apple's rival, Microsoft.    CHANGE OF AIR    The News -- After more than two decades on terrestrial radio, the shock jock Howard Stern began broadcasting by satellite.    Behind the News -- The switch is a gamble for Sirius Satellite Radio, which is paying Mr. Stern hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of attracting more listeners willing to pay a monthly subscription fee. It's also something of a gamble for Mr. Stern, who earned his bad-boy reputation by pushing up against Federal Communications Commission standards on indecency. The new show featured plenty of foul language since, as a satellite show, it falls outside the F.C.C.'s purview. He no longer has the agency to kick around.    FACE CHANGE    The News -- The United States Mint introduced a new version of the nickel, with the portrait of Thomas Jefferson facing front.    Behind the News -- The Treasury has been making a lot of changes lately, particularly in paper money, emphasizing new anticounterfeiting technologies. The changes to the nickel have little to do with technology but may upset purists just the same. In the 97 years that presidents have been stamped on coins, never has one been shown in anything other than profile. Purists had better get used to the new look, however: no further changes to the nickel are in the works.    CHANGING SCENERY    The News -- Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk who shot Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square in 1981, was released from prison in Istanbul.    Behind the News -- The release was strongly criticized by Turkey's justice minister, who said it offended the ''public conscience'' and ordered a review. Mr. Agca, 48, had been convicted not only of shooting the pope but of killing a Turkish journalist. He will remain free while the appeal is heard. But he is also obligated to fulfill his mandatory military service, which he missed while in prison.    CHANGE OF HEART    The News -- The skier Bode Miller apologized for statements he made that suggested he had raced while under the influence of alcohol.    Behind the News -- Miller, the best all-around skier the United States has ever produced, had been under pressure from American and international ski officials to apologize after his remarks on ''60 Minutes.'' While he apologized, he neither admitted nor denied that he had raced after drinking, and he spoke for little more than two minutes without taking questions.

GAMES -- The new Commerzbank Arena will have two highly awaited matches: England vs. Paraguay on June 10, and Argentina vs. the Netherlands on June 21. Portugal-Iran on June 17 is likely to be a lopsided affair, but South Korea-Togo on June 13 could be an entertaining match. There's a quarterfinal on July 1.    HOTELS -- Frankfurt added some 10 new hotels in 2005, including a futuristic Radisson SAS, but rooms are in short supply in the city center. Call the city's tourism hotline (49-69-212-308-08, www.frankfurt-tourismus.de); if need be, ask about the smaller hotels in the villagelike area of Taunus or the old-fashioned town of Wiesbaden.    NO TICKET? -- Games will be shown on an enormous L.E.D. screen floating on the Main River, so pack a picnic and find a spot along the waterfront parks between the Eiserner Steg and the Ignatz-Bubis bridges. Two stages for cabaret and bands will keep the action going during the half.    BAR -- Go where the locals loosen their ties. Sachsenhausen is known for its apfelwein-kneipe, or apple wine taverns. And the King Kamehameha Club (49-694-800-370; www.king-kamehameha.de) is setting up two caged soccer fields at its outdoor Beach Club (Hafeninsel 2).    DOWNTIME -- The undisputed King of Techno, Sven V\u00e4th, recently opened Cocoon, a supper club where diners recline on beds while nibbling diver sea scallops.

And the staff seems to have retired the standard Ritz catchphrase, ''my pleasure,'' and replaced it with the more-relaxed ''no problem.''    LOCATION -- The hotel is set in a wealthy residential community lined with elegant homes. It's about two miles from the restaurants and shops in historic Old Town Pasadena and 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles.    THE SCENE -- My husband and I checked in during a television convention in July when producers in power suits and television talent, ranging from the cast of HBO's ''Entourage'' to costumed super-heroes, stalked the hallways.    THE ROOMS -- Our deluxe king (No. 549) was located in a curve of the main building. Two other complexes, one with balconies that face the pool and another tucked behind it in a more secluded spot, offer a combination of deluxe rooms and suites. There are also eight cottages scattered throughout the property. Our room, near the elevators, was a long rectangle in various shades of beige with blue and gold accents. Two plush armchairs sat at one end and a modest desk equipped with high-speed Internet access was at the other. From the windows we could peek out at the pool or gaze beyond the red-tiled roof of the hotel to the San Gabriel Mountains.    AMENITIES -- The Olympic-size pool was disappointing. Its small seating area was packed three rows deep with lounge chairs and umbrellas, and it was situated just outside a restaurant, putting bathers on display. The hot tub, in a separate, shady grotto, was more inviting. There is also a good-size spa in a separate building that is worth a visit. Use of its fitness center and separate men's and women's whirlpools, steam and sauna rooms are free to guests. So is the coffee, tea and fruit that are laid out every morning.    THE SERVICE  -- Mixed. We were seated quickly and waited on attentively at the Terrace Restaurant. But the business center was rarely staffed, and perhaps because Internet service was free there, guests lingered on the three available computers, causing lines to form. The hotel plans to add a $5 fee for every 10 minutes on the Internet later this month. (A hotel spokeswoman said the attendant at the gift shop, across from the business center, is supposed to staff both stations.)    ROOM SERVICE -- Breakfast -- one egg, over easy, with sourdough toast, turkey sausage and a pot of coffee -- arrived in less than 20 minutes. Cost: $27.22, including a $4.50 in-room dining charge and 18 percent service charge. When we got the munchies around midnight, however, our chicken quesadilla never arrived. When we called room service, about 45 minutes later, to check on it, an employee apologized and said they had sent it to the wrong room. By that time we were too tired to eat and so declined the offer of a new order.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The hotel is working on a balance between formal opulence and casual chic. Some touches, like the painstakingly placed green apples at the check-in desk, are style clich\u00e9s borrowed from boutique hotels. But the high-quality Ritz service is still largely intact.

But on the two mornings I asked if Ms. Rosso was around, I was told with the same cheerfully vague wording, ''She's around, but she's not here right now.'' It would have been nice to meet her.    THE LOCATION -- Wickwood sits in a beautiful and fragrant garden in the center of the town, which is due west of Detroit. The chain ferry, a hand-cranked boat across the Kalamazoo River ($1), is a block away. Marro's, a terrific Italian restaurant, is also within easy walking distance.    THE SCENE -- The 11 rooms, with names like Kyoto and Summer in Santorini, are perfect for romantic getaways; when I was there, guests were young, old, black, white, gay, straight, and all (apparently) in love.    AMENITIES -- Thanks to Ms. Rosso, life at Wickwood revolves around food. Each day began with a lush breakfast (one morning, I had apple bread pudding and cappuccino mousse; another morning, a fabulous frittata). At 6 p.m., the same buffet table was piled with a variety of superb hors d'oeuvres; some guests fill up and don't bother with dinner. Before bedtime, there were more treats, which included brownies and brandy (one as silky as the other). The refrigerator, available to guests 24/7, was stocked with ginger tea, lemonade and fruit juices from heaven. Chocolate-dipped strawberries and a fancy trail-mix were set out in my bedroom.    THE ROOMS -- My room, named Uptown, was decorated with silver-framed photos of New York. And the opulently outfitted bed was stacked with so many pillows it was a chore to take them off. Rooms lack individual temperature controls -- at one point, on a unseasonably warm evening, it was too hot to sleep, and I didn't feel comfortable bothering the staff to adjust the air-conditioning in the middle of the night. Luckily, there was a stack of interesting books next to the bed.    THE BATHROOM -- Small and forgettable. The shower didn't have a lot of pressure. But Wickwood is really about public spaces; the living room, the game room, the porch and the patio couldn't be nicer.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Rooms are $185 to $365, with a two-night minimum on weekends. But I got a nasty surprise at checkout. When I received my bill, I learned that the $269.50 room rate I had been quoted (and which had been repeated to me after I checked in) was no longer valid; I was being charged $313.50. When I asked how this could be, I was shown a copy of Wickwood's reservation confirmation letter. One sentence had already been highlighted for my convenience: ''Please note that Room Rates and Room Assignment are subject to change without prior notification, and balances are subject to those changes.'' (After returning home, I explained the situation to Ms. Rosso in an e-mail message, without identifying myself as a reporter. A week later, I received a note saying I was being credited $66, a happy if belated resolution.)      Wickwood Inn, 510 Butler Street, Saugatuck, Mich.; (800) 385-1174; www.wickwoodinn.com.   FRED A.

[C1.]    New Health Site Aims to Challenge WebMD  A new Web site owned by Healthline Networks acts as a medical search engine, finding articles on ailments and remedies from some 66,000 Web sites it has identified as providing medical content. In doing so, Healthline says it offers consumers a broader choice of information than WebMD, which is by far the most popular single medical resource online, and a more refined choice than general search engines like Google. Healthline's chairman and chief executive, West Shell III, above, said several factors argued in favor of the company's success this time around, after a similar venture was unsuccessful. Consumers remain deeply interested in online health information, he said, and pharmaceutical and other medical advertisers are starting to open their wallets more generously to the Web.

The services are part of a broad new strategy to sell wireless media products directly to consumers. [C1.]    In what is the boldest venture yet by an established media company to insinuate itself into millions of cellphones, the News Corporation has created a mobile entertainment store called Mobizzo and a production studio to focus exclusively on developing cellphone entertainment in much the same way that 20th Century Fox creates movies and television. [Page C1.]    Before Harvard President's Ouster, an Influential Article  Two years ago, when David McClintick, left, agreed to write an expos\u00e9 on Harvard's effort on behalf of the United States government to help Russia privatize its economy in the 1990's, he had little inkling the article would play a part in forcing the ouster of Harvard's president, Lawrence Summers. ''How Harvard Lost Russia'' was published in the January issue of Institutional Investor magazine, a subscription-only publication, about a month and a half before Dr. Summers's resignation, which he announced last Tuesday. The move came just two weeks after a heated Feb. 7 meeting at which Dr. Summers was challenged on several issues, including his reaction to the events described in Mr. McClintick's provocative article. [C3.]    Working to Make Computer Power More Portable  When Samsung decided to mount a serious challenge to Apple Computer's iPod music player early last year, it turned to a Silicon Valley start-up and a small team of programmers led by Paul Mercer, 38, a veteran Apple Macintosh software designer. For Mr. Mercer, the Samsung project is the culmination of more than two decades of focus on extending personal computer technologies into the realm of portable devices. [C1.]    Tense Ties Between White House and Press  By its nature, the relationship between the White House and the press has historically held an inherent tension. And many say the relationship has been eroding since the Vietnam War and Watergate, when reporters had reason to distrust most everything the White House said and made a scandalous ''gate'' out of every murky act. But today, those on both sides say, the relationship has deteriorated further, exacerbated by live White House briefings. [C1.]    Gauging the Marketing Magnetism of the Oscars  Since the nominations for the 78th annual Academy Awards were announced, sponsors have shrugged off skeptics who questioned whether the ceremony, to be broadcast on Sunday by ABC, would draw a sizable audience. None of the five nominees for best picture are box-office blockbusters, the skeptics point out, and few of the nominees for acting awards are household names. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C4.]    If you drill down into this year's best picture nominees, you will find that they are guerrilla insurgencies backed by superpowers. David Carr. [C1.]    Web Companies Turn to 'Pay-Per-Call' Services  Businesses like Ingenio, based in San Francisco, are helping Internet companies move into ''pay-per-call'' services, where consumers on the Web click on an icon to have someone call them or simply dial a number in an ad. Judson Brady, left, the owner of Broad Street Flowers, an Atlanta-based floral service, pays Ingenio around $4.15 for each call from a prospect -- most of whom see his ads on AOL, which introduced its pay-per-call service last year. More than a third of the callers place an order, Mr. Brady said, making it more effective than his ''pay-per-click'' advertising. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report.

A1    The Pentagon announced that it was delaying indefinitely the deployment of an armored brigade to Iraq, in a sign that senior commanders in Iraq may shortly announce cuts in overall troop levels.   A12    Angry Refugees Riot in Darfur  An African Union interpreter was hacked to death in a camp by a mob of angry demonstrators within hours of a visit to a refugee camp from the top United Nations aid official.

A10    President Bush pressed the United Nations to speed up the sending of peacekeeping troops to Darfur. The Security Council agreed in February to plan the deployment, to replace African Union forces, but the planning process appeared to stop after Sudan refused to grant visas to an assessment team.

A18    Compromise in Puerto Rico  The governor of Puerto Rico, An\u00edbal Acevedo-Vil\u00e1, announced that a compromise had been reached to resolve the island's weeklong fiscal crisis, which had forced the governor to furlough 95,000 government employees and led to a week of rallies and vigils.   A18    Malpractice Plan Fails in Senate  For the fourth time in three years, the Senate rebuffed a Republican attempt to limit jury awards in medical malpractice cases.

The discovery may lead to treatment for F.O.P. as well as other bone conditions, like osteoporosis.
