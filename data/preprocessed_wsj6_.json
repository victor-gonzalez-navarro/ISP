        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: Apple Could Release Four New iPhone Models \u2014next year. At least that\u2019s what JP Morgan analyst Samit Chatterjee says. After talking with Apple suppliers, Chatterjee drew up the following expectations: All four of those new Iphone models will have 5G and the batch includes a 6.7-inch model\u2014that would be the largest iPhone yet. That\u2019s an interesting prediction especially because Apple (AAPL) has recently been focusing more on making money from services, like Apple TV+. So why would the company be releasing more iPhone models? The answer, it seems, is that Apple is facing competition from Android phone makers. And rivals like Samsung and Huawei have product release cycles that can be summed up in one word: continuous. And because Thanksgiving fell as late as it did this year, the shipping industry is sweating that shorter delivery window. FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service say they can handle the tighter schedule. They point out that they have invested billions of dollars in things like new sorting facilities and route planning. But this year also features one relatively new player: Amazon (AMZN). The online shopping giant has been expanding its own shipping network and recently cut ties with FedEx (FDX). The shorter delivery window will be a crucial test for the shipping industry going forward\u2014especially since online shopping is expected to be bigger than ever this holiday season. The number was released Monday morning, and it was worse than what economists had expected. It shows that for the fourth month in a row, America\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted. What\u2019s behind the continued malaise? Well, there\u2019s tariffs and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Plus, the global economy is growing more slowly. On top of all that, the U.S. oil market has been hit hard, which means less demand for drilling equipment. And manufacturers are also hurting from one-off events. Boeing\u2019s (BA) 737 MAX problems have hurt aircraft suppliers. And the recent General Motors (GM) strike could have a lingering impact on auto parts makers.

        "content": "Apple Inc. has agreed to pay about $467,000 to settle allegations it violated U.S. sanctions by dealing with a blacklisted entity for more than two years, the Treasury Department said Monday. The Cupertino, Calif.-based technology giant allegedly violated U.S. sanctions by hosting, selling and facilitating the transfer of software applications from a Slovenian software company that was previously blacklisted by the U.S., according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. \u201cIn 2017, we found that we had inadvertently paid a developer on [the] U.S. Treasury\u2019s List of Specially Designated Nationals,\u201d an Apple spokesman said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe reported it to the authorities and fully cooperated with their investigation, which has now been completed.\u201d The settlement amount is small for a company the size of Apple, which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. But the case illustrates how compliance efforts by even sophisticated multinational companies can break down. Apple allegedly entered into an app development agreement with SIS d.o.o., an app developer based in Trzin, Slovenia, in 2008, according to the settlement agreement between OFAC and Apple. In February 2015, OFAC blacklisted SIS and its majority owner Savo Stjepanovic for allegedly being part of an international steroid trafficking network. As a result of the designations, any property that SIS or Mr. Stjepanovic had an interest in were blocked, and U.S. individuals and entities were prohibited from dealing with them. In May 2017, OFAC removed Mr. Stjepanovic and SIS from its blacklist. During the time SIS was blacklisted, Apple made 47 payments related to the company\u2019s blocked apps, including making payments directly to SIS, OFAC said. Apple also collected about $1.2 million from customers that downloaded SIS\u2019s apps. OFAC said the span of time over which the alleged violations happened and the multiple points of failure within Apple\u2019s sanctions compliance program showed \u201creckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements,\u201d according to the agreement. On the day Mr. Stjepanovic and SIS were blacklisted, Apple ran the new designations against its app developer account holder names. But the company\u2019s sanctions-screening tool failed to identify SIS as a blacklisted entity because Apple\u2019s system listed the company as \u201cSIS DOO,\u201d rather than \u201cSIS d.o.o\u201d on OFAC\u2019s list, according to the agreement. Apple allegedly failed to identify Mr. Stjepanovic as a blacklisted individual in its system as well, because Apple didn\u2019t screen all individual users associated with an App Store account at the time, according to the agreement. Apple also allegedly helped transfer the ownership of SIS\u2019s apps to two other companies several months after the designation, according to OFAC. In February 2017, after making changes to its sanctions screening tool and related processes, Apple identified SIS as a blacklisted entity, OFAC said. Apple then suspended making payments to the company that administered SIS\u2019s App Store account, but continued to make payments to the other company that owned some of SIS\u2019s apps for several months after the discovery, according to OFAC. Mr. Stjepanovic didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Efforts to reach SIS for comment weren\u2019t successful. OFAC credited Apple for its voluntary self-disclosure of the alleged violations and concluded the case was nonegregious. OFAC also said the company had made changes to its compliance program, including increasing the role of the company\u2019s global export and sanctions compliance officer in the review and escalation process and expanding sanctions screening to app developers\u2019 payment beneficiaries and associated banks.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.38% helped lift the Dow industrials above 28000 for the first time earlier this month, a milestone that underscored how much the two largest U.S. companies influence major stock indexes. Boosted by optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal and sturdy profit growth, the companies have helped buoy the broader technology sector while they vie for the title of largest U.S. firm. Apple shares have soared 66% this year, pushing it ahead of Microsoft with a $1.16 trillion market value. Revenue growth in Apple\u2019s services business and products outside the iPhone have fueled fresh enthusiasm for the stock. Why do you think shares of Microsoft and Apple have fared better than those of Alphabet and Amazon? Join the conversation below. Even though it has fallen behind its rival in market cap, Microsoft has still had a banner year, with shares rallying 47% to give the software giant a market value of $1.14 trillion. Strength in the company\u2019s cloud-computing segment have helped the Redmond, Wash., company offset slower growth elsewhere. With a combined market value of more than $2.3 trillion, Apple and Microsoft now tower over much of the market and have surged ahead of rivals like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Here\u2019s a look at just how influential the pair has become: With the S&P 500 energy sector trailing the broader market as oil and gas prices stagnate, Apple and Microsoft together are now twice as large as the entire energy group. The sector includes stalwarts such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. but is down more than 9% in the past year, with investors expecting steady production from the U.S. and elsewhere to curb gains in oil and natural gas. $2.3 trillion Apple and Microsoft\u2019s combined market cap $5.9 trillion $3.6 Information technology Health Care $3.4 $2.7 $2.5 Financials Communication services Consumer discretionary $2.4 $1.9 $1.1 Industrials Consumer staples Energy $0.9 $0.8 $0.7 Utilities Real Estate Materials Source: FactSet The tech duo has also eclipsed the combined market size of all the companies in the Russell 2000. The gauge of small-capitalization companies has risen 18% this year, compared with a 24% rise for the S&P 500. The Russell slid alongside banks and shares of other economically-sensitive companies earlier in the year, though so-called cyclical areas of the market have rebounded recently. Together, Apple and Microsoft are also larger than the 197 smallest companies combined in the S&P 500, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They have also eclipsed the index\u2019s consumer staples, materials, real estate and utilities sectors. Apple has benefited from consistent revenue gains in North and South America, reflecting a broader trend of sturdy domestic consumer spending boosting stocks even as economic activity elsewhere stagnates. Sales in Apple\u2019s Americas segment have risen in three consecutive fiscal years through September 2019, helping offset declines in the most recent year in Europe, and the company\u2019s Greater China segment of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. As Apple has relied on strength in its services segment and products outside the iPhone to offset a drop in sales from its flagship product, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing group has pushed the stock higher. The segment includes its Azure product line, and the group\u2019s revenue nearly doubled from the 2014 fiscal year through the 2019 fiscal year ended in June. Annual stock and index performance , 2010-19 66 60% S&P 500 Microsoft Apple 40 20 0 0 Source: FactSet The two largest technology stocks have recently outpaced rivals including Amazon.com and Alphabet, which have lagged behind amid concerns about rising costs and stricter regulations. Amazon shares are up 16% this year, while Alphabet has rallied 24%, putting the pair about $250 billion or more behind Apple and Microsoft in market value. Despite worries the two tech stalwarts have rallied too far, they are still less expensive than peers such as Amazon based on profits in the past year. Apple is also cheaper than the broader technology sector. Shares of both Apple and Microsoft are now on track for their best annual performance since 2009. Microsoft is on pace for an eighth consecutive annual rise, bucking declines for the S&P 500 in 2015 and 2018. \u2014 Kenny Jimenez contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Pour some bubbly in your finest crystal... OK, fine, coffee mug? Plastic cup? Whatever. Now, please raise it\u2026 Here\u2019s to you, laptop keyboards, for your current renaissance. Here\u2019s to pressing on, despite years of unexpected obstacles. Oh, and here\u2019s to you, new Apple MacBook Pro keyboard, for, well, bouncing back. The past decade hasn\u2019t been easy for tiny, square plastic letters. There were the netbooks, the ultrabooks, the 3-in-1 backflipping yoga-doing books that prioritized portability over ergonomics. Some keys were squeezed together like they were on a Scrabble board; others were smooshed flat as if by a steamroller. In 2015, Apple AAPL 0.85% created a new butterfly key mechanism to get its laptops\u2026even thinner. Not only did it feel terrible but also, as I previously reported, all three generations of that keyboard proved unreliable. The company rolled out an unprecedented repair program to address customer complaints. Maybe we needed to endure all that to get us here, to the golden age of the laptop keyboard. The biggest technology companies have finally mastered thin and light computers with keyboards that are a delight for our fingers to dance on. Keys are now quieter, well spaced and have decent \u201ctravel,\u201d a nerd term for how far down the keys press. \u201cWe have seen our competitors missteps, and it created an opening,\u201d says Ben Janofsky, a Google GOOG 0.03% senior product manager. \u201cA laptop keyboard is not a commoditized experience anymore. It can be an area of differentiation.\u201d Surprised I quoted Google? The company\u2019s new Pixelbook Go is out and its keyboard, I\u2019m certain, is what love songs are about. Microsoft MSFT 0.38% perfected its latest keyboard on the Surface Laptop 3. And Apple\u2019s new (yet old) scissor mechanism on the just-launched 16-inch MacBook Pro almost\u2014almost\u2014makes you forget that whole butterfly thing. Are you really going to buy a laptop strictly for its typing bliss, though? Probably not, though given the hours you spend pounding away, it should be a priority. Fortunately, all of these glorious keyboards come attached to nice laptops. The Pixelbook Go has what Google calls \u201chush keys.\u201d Besides sounding like the latest thriller from Jordan Peele, they are an impressive invention. It\u2019s about time someone deliberately muted the clickety clack in meetings. Keyboard noise pollution has been an area of particular focus for companies, including Apple, which also delivers quieter typing on its new MacBook Pro. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.) As you\u2019ll see in my video, I visited an anechoic chamber at Cooper Union, the art, engineering and architecture college in New York City. The room is eerily quiet because it absorbs sonic reflections; you can measure only direct sound coming from objects inside the room. With the help of mechanical-engineering professor Martin Lawless, I set up a decibel meter and typed the same passage on several different laptops. For posterity, I brought a typewriter too. Apple\u2019s butterfly keyboard\u2014still found on most of the company\u2019s laptops including my MacBook Air\u2014was the loudest test subject, at 42 decibels. The keyboards on the Pixelbook and the new MacBook measured around 30 dB each. The typewriter hit 60 dB. (For reference, a vacuum cleaner is around 70 dB.) My test wasn\u2019t scientific\u2014for that, I\u2019d need a typing robot. And I WANT a typing robot. But this isn\u2019t just about the sounds of silence. The soft key coating, the pleasant bounce, the well-spaced layout, all make the Pixelbook Go\u2019s keyboard the best of this lot. It\u2019s even more impressive considering the whole system measures a half-inch thick and weighs just 2.3 pounds. Of course, it\u2019s a Chromebook\u2014and an expensive one at that. At $649, this laptop is mostly just a web browser\u2014and one of the most personal-data hungry ones. But hey, it also runs Android apps and has really great battery life. It lasted a full workday before needing to recharge. By contrast, the 16-inch MacBook Pro couldn\u2019t be more full-powered. I don\u2019t have the strength, nor the bag, to carry this monster around but those who do won\u2019t be disappointed. The display is bright and crisp, the speakers are the best I\u2019ve ever heard on a laptop and there\u2019s a whopping 8-terabyte storage option. Scissor mechanism Butterfly mechanism Keyboard travel Scissor Scissor Butterfly 1.6 mm 1 mm 0.55 mm Pre-2016 2016-18 2019 Source: the company Apple won\u2019t say that the MacBook butterfly keyboard was a mistake, presumably because it\u2019s still in production, but the new keyboard is utterly, absolutely, insanely better. It will be a while before we know if the 16-inch MacBook Pro\u2019s keyboard is reliable\u2014it took four months for the E and R keys on my MacBook Air to give out. But the longer travel on its keys and the quieter typing sound are reasons enough to feel good about it. Sadly, the keyboard is only on this new larger model. Oh, and did I mention it starts at $2,399? But can you really put a price on a Mac laptop with a keyboard that works? The keyboard on Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Laptop 3, which was redesigned since last year\u2019s model, doesn\u2019t necessarily beat out either the new MacBook Pro or the Pixelbook Go boards. Still, the Surface Laptop provides the most excellent and reliable typing experience I\u2019ve ever seen on a Windows laptop. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of Windows laptops in my time. My favorite part is the squared-off edges of the smooth, soft keys and the light bounce you feel when you type\u2014even quite furiously. Typing isn\u2019t as quiet as the others, but the clicking and clacking comes off as satisfying. And Microsoft says that\u2019s deliberate. \u201cYour fingertips want to know the keying is accurate. That can come through feel, but also comes through the sound,\u201d says Edie Adams, Microsoft\u2019s principal ergonomist, who has worked on Microsoft keyboards for the past two decades. How important is the keyboard in your laptop-buying decision? What\u2019s the best keyboard you ever had? Join the conversation below. The Surface Laptop 3 is a very nice Windows laptop otherwise\u2014though my top all-around choice remains the Dell XPS 13 for its smaller footprint and slightly longer battery life. (Since you asked: The Dell\u2019s keyboard has slight improvements, too, but it isn\u2019t as fun as the Surface Laptop 3 to type on.) With that, let\u2019s drink to the exciting future of keyboards, which won\u2019t be going extinct anytime soon. \u201cWe haven\u2019t used up every good idea yet for keyboards for laptops,\u201d Ms. Adams said. \u201cWe have more things to try out.\u201d \u2014\u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas\u2014President Trump criticized China\u2019s efforts to reach a trade agreement during a visit to a Texas plant where Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is assembling its new desktop computer. Mr. Trump toured the Austin facility with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on Wednesday as the White House sought to promote job creation and economic growth against the backdrop of a continuing trade war with Beijing. Few signs of progress have emerged since a plan for a limited \u201cphase one\u201d deal was announced nearly six weeks ago. Asked if he would secure a pact by the end of the year, Mr. Trump said, \u201cChina would much rather make a trade deal than I would\u201d and added, \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted to do it yet. Because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re stepping up to the level that I want.\u201d The president also said he was \u201clooking at\u201d exempting Apple from a coming round of China tariffs. \u201cWe have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung, \u201d he said. Administration officials have for months discussed exempting iPhones from tariff increases, according to people familiar with the conversations. One rationale was that China\u2019s production was deeply dependent on manufacturing and assembly in the country and couldn\u2019t be expected to move operations quickly. Another was that the U.S. didn\u2019t want to let Samsung gain an advantage over Apple because of tariffs. Do you think the Trump administration\u2019s policies have contributed to U.S. job creation? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. More significantly, the officials said, they wanted to avoid a possible consumer backlash from a steep rise in iPhone prices. Trump officials are trying to establish a level of tariffs they consider politically sustainable. South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. , an Apple competitor, has shifted its smartphone production out of China. Because the devices are produced elsewhere, they aren\u2019t subject to tariffs on China-made imports. Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said that he asked Mr. Cook during their meeting if the tech giant could help build 5G wireless networks in the U.S. Referring to Apple, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cThey have it all - Money, Technology, Vision & Cook!\u201d The Trump administration has sought to encourage the expansion of 5G technology in the U.S. Earlier this week, a bipartisan coalition of senators urged the administration to create a new White House position to coordinate 5G policy, warning in a letter that the U.S. could fall behind on developing the technology without a more \u201ccoherent national strategy.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to the plant Wednesday marked his first appearance with Mr. Cook at one of Apple\u2019s assembly lines since the president took office in 2017, after campaigning against the company\u2019s overseas manufacturing practices. Mr. Trump observed the latest Mac Pro being assembled and chatted with Mr. Cook and workers about the process. The Austin facility employs more than 500 people along a 1,000-foot production line, which Apple said is assembling the $6,000 desktop computer to customer specifications. Designed to highlight Apple\u2019s expansion plans in Texas, the trip came on a critical day in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. Wednesday\u2019s hearings on Capitol Hill included testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who directly implicated the president in a campaign to persuade Ukraine\u2019s leader to open probes that would benefit Mr. Trump in his re-election bid. Mr. Trump dismissed the inquiry from the factory floor, saying he did nothing wrong and adding, \u201cThey have to end it now.\u201d Messrs. Trump and Cook were joined by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump. The appearance is the latest example of the close ties between the U.S. president and the Apple CEO. Mr. Trump considers Mr. Cook a friend and has hosted him for dinner in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Cook has served as an adviser to the Trump administration\u2019s workforce policy board. The two have found common ground on taxes and trade, although their views differ on immigration and environmental issues. Underlying the personal relationship is tension over Apple\u2019s practice of making most of its iPhones, Macs and iPads in China. Mr. Trump has placed tariffs on imports of Chinese-made goods and encouraged companies to manufacture products in the U.S., but his pressure on Apple to overhaul its supply chain has had limited success. Apple had planned this year to shift manufacturing of its new Mac Pro computer\u2014at that point its only major U.S.-assembled product\u2014to China. After the Trump administration in September granted tariff exemptions on 10 items, Apple reversed course, saying it would make the high-end desktop device in Texas, where it has been working with contract manufacturer Flex Ltd. since 2013. The company said it has invested more than $200 million in the Mac Pro facility in Austin, though it declined to say over what period. With the previous Mac Pro model in 2013, it reported an investment of $100 million in tooling and other equipment. Apple continues to produce high-volume products such as iPhones and iPads in China, where the company says it indirectly accounts for 3 million jobs through its supply chain. Those products are designed and engineered in California. The tariff exclusions don\u2019t apply to other Apple items facing tariffs, such as the Apple Watch and AirPods, though the company has sought more exemptions. Additional levies are looming in December on iPhones and other products as Mr. Trump\u2019s trade negotiations with China appeared to have slowed. Ahead of the plant visit, the White House stressed Apple\u2019s job creation in the U.S., citing the company\u2019s announcement last year that it would build a second campus in the Austin area for 5,000 employees. Apple relies on 9,000 U.S. suppliers across 50 states. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Since the impeachment process began in late September, Mr. Trump has held rallies, White House events and made official trips. In October, he attended the ribbon-cutting for a new Louis Vuitton factory in September. The president and his advisers see job creation as a key re-election argument heading into 2020. While the economy has cooled, it is continuing to expand, with employers hiring and wage growth ticking upward. \u2014Bob Davis and Andrew Restuccia contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s flagship television series \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d is a glossy, star-studded program designed to draw subscribers for the company\u2019s new streaming service. The show also, it turns out, doubles as an extended commercial for the gadgets that drive Apple\u2019s business. While Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell have top billing in the drama about a morning news program gone haywire after an anchor\u2019s sexual misconduct, the iPhones, iPads and Macs in the show might have deserved their own trailer and makeup room given all their time on camera. Apple products are visible in an average of 32 camera shots per episode, and an Apple logo is visible in roughly one-third of those shots, according to a Wall Street Journal tally from viewing all 10 episodes of the first season. Rival brands are scarce. \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d made its debut last week to mixed critical reviews but very favorable audience reaction, according to the review-aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. It is the flagship series for Apple\u2019s TV+, a $4.99-a-month subscription service designed to help lessen the company\u2019s dependency on its iPhone business at a time of slowing sales. Apple is offering the service free for a year with a purchase of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac. Hollywood agents, writers and actors have been watching Apple\u2019s shows closely to see how it would handle its first foray into original TV programming. Among their questions: Would the shows be a vehicle to push Apple\u2019s own products? \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d wastes little time giving Apple screen time. The first scene of the first episode opens with the character of executive producer Chip Black, played by Mark Duplass, sprawled on the floor of his office in the dark, feet away from a Mac computer, when the iPhone next to him lights up with an incoming call. About 20 seconds later, Steve Carell\u2019s soon-to-be-disgraced anchor, Mitch Kessler, is awakened by his iPhone. In total, there are 31 shots of Apple devices in Episode 1, including eight with the company\u2019s logo. The other shows in the initial batch of nine programs for TV+ aren\u2019t really conducive to product placement. Several are set in times when Apple doesn\u2019t exist, while others are children\u2019s shows or nonfiction programs that couldn\u2019t easily accommodate gadget shots. Product placement has surged over the past decade as marketers aim to get their brand in front of viewers who increasingly skip commercials and watch shows on demand. Spending on product placement has doubled since 2012 to about $10 billion, according to PQ Media, a media research firm that tracks the industry. \u201cIn a changing world where people watch less traditional television, especially younger audiences, how do you reach them?\u201d said Patrick Quinn, president of PQ Media. \u201cOne way to do that is to launch your own streaming service and show off your product. Not everyone can do that, but Apple can.\u201d For a new show with an undefined audience, assigning a value to an episode\u2019s display of iPhones and other Apple items would be difficult, said Mr. Quinn. For a prime-time show on a traditional network, though, it would be worth tens of millions of dollars, he said. Apple has said it doesn\u2019t pay for product placement. People close to \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d said producers weren\u2019t under pressure to include Apple products in the shows. Jarrod Moses, chief executive of United Entertainment Group, an entertainment and brand consulting firm, said he expected \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d to be loaded with Apple products. \u201cI went into the show thinking that was a given,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI probably would have been shocked if I saw less.\u201d Mr. Moses, who watched the first three episodes, said Apple\u2019s high visibility in the show \u201cseemed pretty harmonious to the actual set and the characters.\u201d The iPhone appears so often in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d that it can seem like an appendage. Reese Witherspoon\u2019s character, Bradley Jackson, manages to take off her leather jacket in one scene without putting down her iPhone. Another character holds on to her iPhone while getting amorous with a co-worker. Other Apple products that get good screen time include MacBooks and iMacs, iPads, AirPods and the occasional Apple Watch. Even the HomePod speaker, widely seen as a disappointment for Apple, makes cameos as a staple on a producer\u2019s office desk. In one four-second scene in Episode 2, nine Apple products are shown as two characters walk and talk through the newsroom, according to the Journal count. Scenes like that might be the result of the show being overzealous in its product placement, said Patricia Ganguzza, president of AIM Productions Inc., a product-placement firm that has worked with programs such as NBC\u2019s \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d \u201cI look at it and say: How brilliant is it for Apple to go into the content business?\u201d said Ms. Ganguzza. \u201cWouldn\u2019t we rather watch a show with product than watch the commercials?\u201d Does product placement distract you, or do you consider it a given in media today? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Of course, many Apple products are very popular\u2014the iPhone has a 35% share of the U.S. smartphone market. Producers have long featured Apple products in television shows and movies. In 2010, ABC\u2019s sitcom \u201cModern Family\u201d devoted an entire episode to the family\u2019s efforts to get an iPad, which had just hit the market. Apple didn\u2019t pay for the placement but it did donate the device. \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d isn\u2019t an entirely Apple-only world. The 10-plus hours of the first season feature at least one device that wasn\u2019t an iPhone: The estranged father of Ms. Witherspoon\u2019s character uses a flip phone during a call with his daughter. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.

        "content": "Apple Inc. will commit $2.5 billion toward affordable housing in California, the latest tech giant to pledge a large sum to help address concerns that Silicon Valley\u2019s successes have pushed people out of the area. The company said Monday it would invest $1 billion in an affordable housing investment fund that will help the state develop and build additional low- to moderate-income housing. Apple said it would invest another $1 billion to help more first-time home buyers with financing and down-payment assistance. The tech company will use $300 million worth of its land to develop affordable housing in San Jose, Calif., it said. An additional $200 million will go toward low-income housing in the Bay Area, Apple said. The commitment includes $150 million toward a low-income housing fund and a $50 million donation to the nonprofit Destination: Home. Apple\u2019s announcement follows similar, though smaller, commitments by several other tech titans to address affordable housing. Facebook Inc. said last month that it would provide $1 billion to help ease a shortage of such housing in the region. In June, Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google made a $1 billion commitment to building housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. Microsoft Corp. said in January it would spend $500 million on new housing in the Seattle area around its Redmond, Wash., headquarters, a region where the tech boom also has caused shortages of affordable housing. The tech companies are among the richest in the world. Apple and Microsoft have market capitalizations above $1 trillion, and the iPhone maker last week reported $55.26 billion in net profit for its latest fiscal year. It held more than $200 billion in cash and similar assets at the end of September. The tech industry\u2019s boom over the past decade has fueled growth in high-income jobs in Silicon Valley and the Seattle area that have rapidly pushed up home prices. That has helped make the areas unaffordable for many middle-class workers, including teachers and emergency responders, and increasingly is impinging on further growth plans for the companies in their home regions. The median selling price for an existing single-family home in the San Francisco Bay Area in September was $880,000, down year-over-year but still higher than the state median of $605,680 and the national median of $275,100, data from state and national real-estate groups show. \u201cThe sky-high cost of housing\u2014both for homeowners and renters\u2014is the defining quality-of-life concern for millions of families across this state, one that can only be fixed by building more housing,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in Apple\u2019s news release announcing its $2.5 billion commitment. The company said its new funding commitments will take about two years and that capital it earns on the investments will be reinvested in future projects over the next five years. \u201cBefore the world knew the name Silicon Valley, and long before we carried technology in our pockets, Apple called this region home, and we feel a profound civic responsibility to ensure it remains a vibrant place where people can live, have a family and contribute to the community,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook said in the news release. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. \u2014Tripp Mickle contributed to this article.",

        "content": "When AirPod zombies don\u2019t acknowledge what you are saying, one of two things is happening: A. They can\u2019t hear you. B. They can hear you but choose not to. (Like you haven\u2019t done that!) With Apple\u2019s AAPL 0.85% newest AirPods Pro, which went on sale last Wednesday, you should now always assume the answer is A. Unlike the $159, one-size-fits-most AirPods, which are still available, the $249 AirPods Pro have active noise canceling. That is, they aim to shut you off from all the annoying sounds of the world so you can be alone with your fave Celine Dion playlist. The new pods also are sweat- and water-resistant, equipped with improved microphones and come with three different size silicone tips for a better fit. What\u2019s not improved? How easy they are to lose. (Also, battery life.) Just like that you\u2019re left with a rush of questions about which AirPods to buy, or which of their rapidly multiplying competitors. (Every tech company with a voice assistant has announced wireless earbuds this fall.) Should you get\u2014or hold on to\u2014the more affordable, totally decent AirPods? Or go for the more expensive, totally better ones? After nearly a week of testing, I\u2019ve got answers to those questions and more about these cute little earwax collectors. Whatever you decide, just promise to remember my Apple \u201cPro\u201d tip: You must weigh how much you\u2019ll use that \u201cpro\u201d feature\u2014be it an iPhone camera, a MacBook\u2019s Touch Bar or the improved sound of a tiny plastic ear bud\u2014before forking over the increasingly painful surcharge. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.) They really do. You notice it in almost any song you listen to. Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cTusk\u201d (my go-to test) sounded noticeably fuller, compared with how it sounds in regular AirPods. The horns are sharper and the vocals are clearer. The Pro\u2019s fuller bass on Queen\u2019s \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d left the AirPods sounding like an old clock radio. Even phone calls sound better. And then there\u2019s my toddler, barking dog and always-running washing machine. In my house, I could hear the songs and nothing else. The noise cancellation isn\u2019t as fully immersive as in my $350 over-the-ear Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones (which also have richer sound and deeper bass), but I was still able to escape crowded subways, street noise and the morning ruckus at home. I put regular AirPods, the AirPod Pros\u2014er, AirPods Pro\u2014Amazon Echo Buds and Samsung Galaxy Buds through my hair dryer test. With a hair dryer at full blast, the AirPod Pros and the Echo Buds did the best job of blocking out the noise. The regular AirPods, predictably, fared the worst. Well, great noise canceling also means blocking the sound of an oncoming car, a train announcer or a \u201cHEY MISS!! YOU LEFT BEHIND YOUR CREDIT CARD!!\u201d That\u2019s why there\u2019s a Don\u2019t-Get-Hit-By-a-Bus mode, which Apple boringly calls Transparency. Switch on Transparency via the settings\u2014accessible through the Control Center or Settings menu\u2014or by pressing and holding one of the AirPod stems. You\u2019ll definitely hear more noises around you. Unlike others that have this feature, the pass-through audio sounds natural and not amplified. With Amazon\u2019s Echo Buds, I can actually hear more chatter around me than if I weren\u2019t wearing them. (Yes, lovely couple to the left of me on the subway, you really should go to his parents for Thanksgiving.) Apple wants these to fit so well that it includes a special sizing tool to help you figure out which silicone tips to use. Attach the likeliest winners, put the buds in your ear, press the Ear Tip Fit Test on your iPhone and you\u2019ll get a fit rating. That said, the tool often said \u201cgood seal\u201d when I was wearing both the small and medium tips. The multiple tips and trying-on process don\u2019t seem very Apple or Jony Ive-ish. Still, they fit well and comfortably\u2014even over long periods of wear and during strenuous physical activity. In my mechanical-bull test, I couldn\u2019t get them to fall out. (See video.) Same when I gave them to some back-flipping, crazy-spinning street performers. (Also in the video.) Two days later, as I was eating, one fell right into my bagel. Turns out aggressive chewing is what it takes to break the seal and knock \u2019em out. Another reason they stay put? The shorter stems. My jacket or hair often gets stuck on the regular AirPods. The biggest downside to the very-white rubber tips is ear gunk. I\u2019ll spare you a detailed description. Sure, you can clean them, or replace them for $4 at an Apple Store. But, Apple, what law states that AirPods must be white and only white? The capacitive force sensors in the stems have tricks that take some getting used to: \u2022One squeeze to play, pause or answer a call \u2022Two squeezes to skip forward \u2022Three squeezes to skip backward \u2022Press and hold to jump between noise cancellation and Don\u2019t-Get-Hit-By-a-Bus mode Volume controls and anything else is a job for Siri. As with the new cheaper AirPods, saying \u201cHey Siri\u201d triggers Apple\u2019s not-exactly-beloved virtual assistant. Yet for most of the tasks you want on-the-go, Siri does just as good a job as Alexa, which is integrated into the Amazon Echo Buds. Initiating a call, sending a text or email, searching for music\u2014Siri did it admirably, if not better than Alexa, because of its deep integration with Apple services. This, and the way the AirPods Pro talk to iOS, makes them the best choice for iPhone owners. As a texting-and-walking addict (I\u2019m working on it!), I particularly like the new feature where Siri reads back new messages. Siri\u2019s reading capabilities and its speech-to-text capabilities for my responses have been impressive. So yes, the new AirPods Pro are great. If sound quality or comfort is important to you, you\u2019ll probably buy them. Heck, Apple\u2019s already betting that the biggest customers will be AirPod upgraders. Do the noise cancellation and improved sound quality of the AirPods Pro tempt you to upgrade\u2014or even buy AirPods for the first time? Join the conversation below. But buying AirPods feels like a bigger decision than a couple hundred dollars. First, there\u2019s the environmental factor. Like older AirPods, these are yet more disposable tech and not all that repairable. When the battery goes or something gets damaged, they are often just tossed out. Apple does have a $49-per-bud battery replacement program, and it says it does recycle them. Speaking of, battery life on these isn\u2019t improved\u2014in fact, noise canceling will run down the battery a bit faster. The new charging case, though not as fun to flick open one-handed, still provides more than 24 hours of overall listening before having to head back to a wall outlet or wireless charging pad. Then, there\u2019s that zombie problem. You will never want to take off the AirPods Pro. You\u2019ll want to wear them in more places, for longer periods, drowning out more of the world around you. Maybe, just maybe, that isn\u2019t the best thing for the world. Maybe we\u2019ve finally taken the old don\u2019t-talk-to-strangers rule too far. \u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is showing it has life beyond the iPhone, reporting growth in other gadgets and services in the latest quarter that outweighed further pain in its bedrock business. The tech giant reported revenue rose 1.8% in the September quarter to $64.04 billion, driven by rising sales of wearables including its smartwatch and services such as apps, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments. Those gains helped offset a 9.2% decline in iPhone sales, which have been falling for the past year. Profit fell 3% to $13.69 billion. That topped expectations but marked the first time since Chief Executive Tim Cook took over in 2011 that Apple\u2019s profit has declined in all four quarters of a fiscal year. The company\u2019s operating expenses have risen considerably since 2017 when it introduced a pricier new iPhone with facial-recognition technology and increased its spending on research and development. Revenue and profit for the fiscal year through September both edged down, their first annual declines since 2016. Apple has responded to the challenge of a maturing smartphone market by accelerating sales of software, services and accessories across the 900 million iPhones in use world-wide. The company said sales of its services business rose 18% in the latest quarter, while sales in its wearables business soared 54% on the popularity of its AirPods wireless earbuds. The company is expanding on its entertainment push with the launch Friday of its new Apple TV+ streaming service. Still, services and wearables together brought in $19 billion in quarterly revenue, less than 60% of the iPhone. Apple reassured investors that its new iPhone 11 models are being well received, offering guidance for the current period that largely exceeded Wall Street\u2019s projections. It expects sales between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion for the period, an improvement on the $84.31 billion it posted in the current quarter last year. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said Apple is on track for a strong Christmas sales season thanks to customer interest in the newest iPhones and the addition of new wearables, including a pricier version of AirPods that went on sale this week. He added that the company\u2019s China business has improved considerably and said Chinese customers\u2019 initial response to the new iPhones has been \u201cvery, very good.\u201d \u201cWe think the iPhone performance will improve versus what we\u2019ve seen in fiscal 2019,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. \u201cWe think wearables will be very strong.\u201d Some investors have feared new iPhone models introduced in September would fail to catch on with consumers, and weigh on sales in the coming year because they offer limited new features. The iPhone still accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s revenue. \u201cThe new phones are proving to be enough,\u201d said Stephen Lee, principal at Logan Capital Management, an Ardmore, Pa.-based investment adviser with $3 billion under management that counts Apple among its largest holdings. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year where smartphones are transitioning and management has done the things necessary to be relevant when 5G is ready.\u201d Apple said per-share earnings in the latest quarter were $3.03. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected earnings of $2.83 a share. Shares of Apple rose nearly 2% in after-hours trading. Before the report, the stock ended basically flat Wednesday at $243.26. Apple shares have surged in recent months, partly in anticipation that the company will release its first 5G iPhone in September 2020. Wall Street analysts expect the company to return to iPhone revenue growth in the fiscal year ending in September 2021. Apple\u2019s operating expenses rose 9% in the quarter, outpacing revenue growth. Spending has jumped in recent years as it added features such as facial-recognition technology to iPhones and poured more money into research and development. Other tech giants have been in a similar pattern, and tech shares, which have surged in recent months, gave up some gains this week as companies reported spending more to fuel their core businesses. Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday posted a 23% decline in profit as spending on people and infrastructure rose. Last week, Amazon.com Inc. reported a 26% profit decline, partly because of increased shipping costs. \u201cTo find new categories of innovation at these companies that are hitting up against the law of large numbers, you have to really invest to sustain existing categories or add new categories,\u201d said Mike Olson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co. He said investors are accepting of that if the spending eventually translates to faster growth. The past year has been one of Apple\u2019s rougher stretches. It started with the company slashing guidance for the first time in more than a decade because of weak iPhone sales and a downturn in its China business. Later, two of its top executives\u2014design chief Jony Ive and retail chief Angela Ahrendts \u2014announced their departure. On Friday, the company is scheduled to charge into the streaming wars with the launch of its Apple TV+ video service. It is betting its distribution and brand power will help persuade people to spend subscription money on a $4.99 service with a handful of shows. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold move, and\u2026the price is very aggressive as well,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Wednesday\u2019s earnings call, where he praised the quality of the shows. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s core iPhone business is showing signs of improvement. The 9% decline in sales for September marked an improvement from the 15% decline reported over the three previous quarters. Mr. Maestri said iPhone sales had improved in the past two quarters as Apple reduced prices in some markets because of the strong dollar and made it easier to trade-in old iPhones, which essentially subsidized a new smartphone purchase. The company also slashed the price on its new, entry-level iPhone by $50 from the predecessor model. The pricing moves have been particularly helpful in China, which has been crimped by an economic slowdown and battered by competition from domestic rivals including Huawei Technologies Co. Sales in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 2.4% to $11.13 billion, an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year when sales dropped more than 20%. In China, the company shipped an estimated 5.1 million iPhones in the September period, a 28% decrease from a year earlier, according to Canalys, a market research firm. Apple offset that partly through strong App Store sales, which rose nearly 30% to $4.1 billion, according to app-tracking firm Sensor Tower, as approval of new gaming apps has resumed after being halted last year. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal fourth quarter after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know. EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts on average expect a profit of $2.83 a share, according to a survey by FactSet. Apple hasn\u2019t provided profit guidance for the quarter but in June, it said it expected gross margin of about 37.5% to 38.5%. REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect $63.0 billion, according to FactSet, compared with $62.9 billion a year earlier. In June, Apple said it expected revenue of $61 billion to $64 billion for the quarter. WHAT TO WATCH: Papa\u2019s Got a Brand New Bag: The most important number Apple delivers on Wednesday will be its sales projection for the current quarter. The estimate is a bellwether for the fiscal year ahead, providing the first indication of its latest gadgets\u2019 appeal. Analysts are projecting sales of $86.71 billion for the current period, according to FactSet. Last year, Apple projected sales of $89 billion to $93 billion, though the company later slashed guidance for the first time in more than 15 years. A strong revenue forecast for the December quarter would assure investors the iPhone franchise has stabilized behind the new iPhone 11 models. It also could illuminate sales expectations for new, pricier AirPods that it started selling this week, which are expected to lift a product line that accounted for about $2 billion in sales in the June quarter, according to Bernstein Research. I Love L.A.: On Friday, Apple launches its most visible new subscription product: TV+. The streaming-subscription product, priced at $4.99 a month, features \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. To encourage trial and device sales, Apple is offering a free subscription to customers who buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac. The free offering has been a point of contention between Apple and analysts, who are likely to ask about how the company will account for it. Analysts say Apple will have to account for it by shifting about $60 for a year of the service from an iPhone sale and recognizing that $60 as services revenue. In September, Apple told CNBC the service wouldn\u2019t have a material impact on its financial results. Not Fade Away: After getting hit by a major downturn of iPhone sales in China to start fiscal 2019, Apple made moves to stabilize the business. A combination of lower prices, trade-in promotions and financing helped it post a 4% decline in revenue for the quarter ended in June\u2014a major improvement from the more than 20% decreases in the prior two quarters. Investors will be watching to see if Apple extended those gains in the September quarter. Smartphone sales data from the Chinese government showed iPhone shipment growth in two of the past three months, according to UBS, which is encouraging given the continuing trade war. The data has led some analysts to increase iPhone shipment estimates for the September quarter. Lively Up Yourself: For growth in recent quarters, Apple has focused on increasing software and services sales across the 900 million iPhones in use world-wide. A year ago, that business\u2014which includes the App Store, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments\u2014stalled as China slowed the approval of new gaming apps. The resumption of those approvals has set the company up for a strong uptick in services sales for the September quarter, analysts say. They estimate services rose 15% to $12.22 billion, a roughly $1.6 billion increase, according to FactSet.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is introducing a high-end version of its AirPods wireless earbuds with a new design and noise cancellation, as the tech giant looks to broaden its offering of wearable products amid lackluster iPhone sales. AirPods have emerged as one of Apple\u2019s most successful new products. Sales of the devices rose an estimated 70% in the quarter ended in June to about $2 billion, according to Bernstein Research, helping the company offset its flagging iPhone business and deliver revenue growth for the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year. The addition of a Pro line of AirPods, which cost $249, follows in the company\u2019s tradition of offering a high-end, pricier model of a core product\u2014featuring more bells-and-whistles\u2014and a lower-priced, entry-level version with fewer features. Apple offers Pro versions of its Mac computer, iPad tablets and iPhone lines. The new earbuds are the first Pro offering of a wearable device. The popularity of wireless earbuds has driven Apple rivals to offer their own versions. Microsoft Corp. this month said it would sell such devices . Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google also said it would introduce wireless earbuds due out next year. The AirPods Pro feature a new design with silicone ear tips that Apple says conform to each individuals\u2019 ears. They have noise-cancellation capabilities to eliminate background noise, longer battery life and a mode that allows users to listen to music while also hearing the environment around them, Apple says. The new AirPods are available to order now and can be purchased at Apple stores starting Oct. 30. The new model lifts the average-selling price of AirPods 27% to $202. When Apple first introduced AirPods in 2016 they were priced at $159. The increase is the latest example of Apple raising the average price of a product as it tries to maintain sales growth amid a decline in unit sales of the iPhone, which still accounts for more than half of total revenue. It previously used the pricing strategy with the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell 15% to $109.02 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 ended in June. The introduction of the iPhone 11 should help arrest that slide, analysts say, when Apple, the largest publicly traded company, reports earnings Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the old telecom strategy: Apple has the customer, so how do they trade them up,\u201d said Roger Kay, analyst and founder of Endpoint Technologies Associates. \u201cWith the iPhone topping out, turning to accessories is a tried-and-true strategy, and selling them at higher prices with a new design makes sense, especially for Apple customers who like to signal that they have the latest technology.\u201d Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Corrections & Amplifications The new AirPods are available to order online now. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the new AirPods will be available to order online starting Oct. 30.

        "content": "With the threat of tariffs on iPhones approaching in August, Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% stood to lose billions of dollars in profit. Chief Executive Tim Cook reached out to one of his most important contacts in Washington, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner arranged a call between Mr. Cook and his father-in-law, President Trump, people familiar with the call said, giving the Apple chief a chance to explain how tariffs would increase iPhone prices and impair Apple\u2019s ability to compete against rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. Within days, the Trump administration scaled back its tariff plan to exempt a swath of electronics products, including iPhones, saying it wanted to protect consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season. The call from Mr. Cook influenced the decision, a person close to the administration said. A day after that move, Apple issued a press release trumpeting job growth, saying that since 2011 it had quadrupled the number of jobs its business supports in the U.S. Later, Mr. Trump publicly praised Mr. Cook\u2019s power of persuasion, saying the CEO had made a compelling argument about tariffs. The events encapsulated Mr. Cook\u2019s diplomacy in the Trump era. To protect his company\u2019s interests, people close to the company and administration said, the Apple CEO has cultivated a relationship with the president and his family, an unlikely alliance given their contrasting personalities and divergent views on many issues. The rapport between Mr. Cook, a Hillary Clinton supporter in 2016 who fashioned Apple\u2019s outsourcing strategy, and Mr. Trump, a Republican who campaigned against Apple\u2019s China-based manufacturing, has served each man\u2019s interests in such areas as trade and tax reform, even as they remain divided over immigration and climate change. The nascent impeachment inquiry is unlikely to have an immediate effect on the relationship, according to people close to Apple. Mr. Cook is expected to continue to engage on issues related to the company\u2019s business while steering clear of politics and pushing back on social issues. Mr. Cook serves as an adviser to the administration\u2019s workforce policy board, and the two have dined together the past two summers at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Trump refers to the Apple CEO as a friend and lauds his business chops. He has called Mr. Cook to wish him a Happy Thanksgiving, a person familiar with the matter said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great executive,\u201d Mr. Trump said recently. \u201cOthers go out and hire very expensive consultants. Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.\u201d Mr. Trump has spent more of his working time than predecessors with corporate leaders, said presidential historian Jeremi Suri, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He said those relationships tend to focus more on administration priorities such as trade and tariffs than the broader economy, a focal point of past administrations. Mr. Cook is one of the few executives in a hyperpolarized political era who has managed to both support and challenge the president\u2019s agenda in a way that has kept him in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces while avoiding any public backlash from either employees or customers. Such engagement has proved risky for other chief executives. Facing public pressure, Under Armour Inc. \u2019s Kevin Plank, Tesla Inc. \u2019s Elon Musk and Uber Technologies Inc. \u2019s Travis Kalanick resigned from presidential advisory councils over disagreements with the administration. A similar resignation by Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier, who publicly criticized the president\u2019s handling of violence in Charlottesville, Va., led Mr. Trump to unleash a barrage of tweets castigating the drugmaker for high prices. \u201cThere are only a handful [of executives] who have been able to thread the needle,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University management professor who has informally advised Mr. Trump over the years before he became president. \u201cThis is a newfound capability for Apple. Steve Jobs didn\u2019t have influence in Washington, and Tim Cook has offered it.\u201d He added that Mr. Trump\u2019s volatility means the relationship with Mr. Cook could change, but that was unlikely in the near term. Apple declined to make Mr. Cook available for an interview. The White House said Mr. Trump declined to comment. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.) Mr. Cook\u2019s personal diplomacy stands out among tech giants. Others have sharply increased their outlays on lobbying in recent years but haven\u2019t forged close ties to the administration. Apple\u2019s $18 million in lobbying since 2017 is half of what either Amazon.com Inc. or Google\u2019s Alphabet Inc. have spent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Cook fostered close ties with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, giving him a backchannel to the White House. He also meets regularly with administration officials such as economic adviser Larry Kudlow. Despite his personal preference for privacy, he has attended publicly promoted dinners and meetings with Mr. Trump, said people close to Apple and the administration. Nearly 97% of Apple employee donations to candidates in the 2018 midterm elections went to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, citing public disclosures. Yet employees haven\u2019t publicly criticized Mr. Cook for engaging with the president. Mr. Cook has challenged the president on some social issues. His personal lobbying benefited the company on the tariff issue, and tax changes that led to employee bonuses. At a March meeting, President Trump introduced Mr. Cook as \u201cTim Apple\u201d\u2014a mistake that ricocheted across social media. Trump supporters laughed, while critics painted it as yet another presidential gaffe. Mr. Cook responded by updating his name on Twitter to use the Apple logo in place of his last name. Presidential supporters read it as an inside joke between the two leaders, while opponents interpreted it as a jab at the president. \u201cThere are a lot of folks in Silicon Valley who reek of disdainfulness for politics,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), who regularly meets with Mr. Cook. \u201cThey often presume they\u2019re much smarter than anyone in policy\u2026Tim doesn\u2019t have that approach. He actually listens.\u201d Mr. Cook grew up outside Mobile, Ala., the son of a shipyard worker, and earned an engineering degree at Auburn University and an M.B.A. from Duke. He is an operations wizard, skilled at minimizing costs. In his previous role at Apple, he shifted production from the U.S. to China, and helped build a business there that accounts for one-fifth of Apple\u2019s revenue. What\u2019s the best way for a CEO to engage with this White House? Join the conversation below. Mr. Trump was elected president after promising to rebuild American manufacturing and place tariffs on Chinese goods. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Apple to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries,\u201d he said during a 2016 campaign speech. The month after his election, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Cook to meet in New York. Apple executives debated skipping the summit, worried Mr. Trump would air grievances about manufacturing and Apple\u2019s commitment to encrypted iPhones, according to a person familiar with the company. But people who knew Mr. Trump encouraged Mr. Cook to attend, this person said. Mr. Trump was friendly and charming, said people familiar with the meeting. He told Mr. Cook he looked forward to working together and encouraged the CEO to contact Mr. Kushner with any issues. Mr. Cook spoke about Apple\u2019s manufacturing practices, drawing a contrast between smartphone production and automobile manufacturing, according to these people. Most of the value in the iPhone came from the design and engineering, he said, and the Chinese workers who did the assembly received low wages, so how could those jobs be good for U.S. workers? He told Mr. Trump that a trade war with China would be a big problem for major American companies such as Apple. Messrs. Trump and Kushner appreciated Mr. Cook\u2019s approach, and felt he was someone they could work with, a former senior administration official said. Mr. Cook came away from the meeting with a sense that Mr. Trump listened and that they could work together, one of the people familiar with the company said. When Mr. Cook was in Washington the following month, he had dinner with Mr. Kushner and his wife at Ristorante Tosca. Their early rapport was tested a month later when Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending entry to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority nations. The order disrupted airports and triggered protests at Google, where thousands of people staged a walkout. Mr. Cook, an immigration advocate, was surprised. Apple later told the administration it disapproved of the measure. Mr. Cook emailed Apple employees, saying he made clear to officials in Washington that the company and nation wouldn\u2019t exist without immigration. His ties to the White House, though, remained intact. A few months later, current and former administration officials said, Ms. Trump called on Mr. Cook for help: Would he speak to her father about his plan to exit from the Paris Climate Accord? Mr. Cook\u2019s appeal to preserve the U.S. commitment to the climate agreement didn\u2019t succeed, these people said, but it allowed him to convey his feelings to the president directly before sending an email to employees that criticized exiting the climate agreement. Mr. Cook has said he relies on a simple formula before weighing in, asking himself: Does Apple have a right to talk about this? Do we have standing? He speaks out about education, privacy, human rights, immigration and the environment. \u201cI don\u2019t think business should only deal in commercial things,\u201d he said at a conference last year. Before challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s policies publicly, though, often he or a member of Apple\u2019s public-affairs team alerts the White House through Mr. Kushner or other senior White House officials, former administration officials said. At other times, Mr. Cook holds his tongue. When the president told the Journal in July 2017 that Mr. Cook promised to build \u201cthree big plants, beautiful plants\u201d in the U.S., the company declined to comment, pointing to past statements about its reliance on U.S. suppliers for components. While Mr. Cook had spoken with the president about manufacturing around that time, the CEO hadn\u2019t discussed three plants in the U.S., a person familiar with the company said. The CEO didn\u2019t challenge Mr. Trump because \u201cit would have been a tweet war,\u201d the Journal reported last year, citing another person familiar with the company. \u201cIn being measured and thoughtful, he doesn\u2019t create crisis when there doesn\u2019t need to be one, or antagonism when there doesn\u2019t need to be any,\u201d one of the former administration officials said of Mr. Cook. When Mr. Trump began working toward a planned tax cut in 2017, Mr. Cook told the president that Apple would invest more in the U.S. if it could bring its $250 billion in overseas cash back to the U.S. at a lower tax rate, one of the former administration officials said. Mr. Trump later cited Mr. Cook and Apple as he promoted a tax overhaul, this person added. In early 2018, less than a month after the tax bill was signed, Apple announced it would contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years\u2014a figure that included spending on parts and services, capital spending and tax payments. Even though that was consistent with Apple\u2019s previous spending levels in the U.S., Mr. Cook went on ABC News to tout the commitment, as well as Apple\u2019s promise to develop a new Apple campus, which it later awarded to Austin, Texas. Mr. Trump praised Apple later that month during the State of the Union address, saying its spending was an example of the benefits of tax cuts. Over time, the administration began to rely on Mr. Cook for insight into trade and business issues around the world, including in China, Brazil and Europe, former and current senior administration officials said. Trade remained a major sticking point. Mr. Cook told Mr. Trump regularly that a trade war would harm U.S. companies. Mr. Trump often told Mr. Cook he wanted Apple to add jobs in the U.S. To ward off criticism of its overseas manufacturing, Apple rebranded commitments to U.S. manufacturing as spending from an \u201cAdvanced Manufacturing Fund\u201d program, one of the people close to the company said. Previously, similar spending commitments with suppliers weren\u2019t publicized. Early this year, Mr. Cook joined the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board led by Ms. Trump. The group, which includes the CEOs of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Siemens USA, aims to help U.S. employers and the government better train workers. Last year, when the White House announced duties on $200 billion of Chinese-made goods, it exempted a group of products including Apple\u2019s smartwatch and wireless earbuds. But the tariff threat re-emerged in May when Mr. Trump threatened tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese goods. The tariffs would have increased the price of new iPhones, on average, by about $40, and reduced Apple\u2019s per-share earnings by more than 20%, according to analysts. Despite the tariff threat, Apple made plans to manufacture a new version of its Mac Pro in China. The current version of the computer was produced in Austin, Texas. After the president said in August he planned to move forward with the tariffs, Mr. Cook reached out to Mr. Kushner, who set up the phone call with the president that helped persuade the Trump administration to spare iPhones and other products from tariffs. The president later said Mr. Cook made the case that tariffs would give Samsung an advantage over Apple because the South Korean company wouldn\u2019t have to pay duties. The plea clicked with Mr. Trump, according to former senior administration officials. He wants to stop countries such as China from competing unfairly against the U.S., and for American multinationals to succeed world-wide. Several weeks later, Apple reversed its plan for the Mac Pro, announcing it would continue to make it in Austin, after the administration granted exclusions on tariffs for some Chinese-made components in the desktop computer. \u201cThe reason I speak to Tim Cook: He\u2019s the one that calls me,\u201d Mr. Trump said in August.",

        "content": "Here\u2019s the best thing about the new Apple AAPL 0.85% Watch Series 5: You don\u2019t need to buy it. Why buy when you can just glance down at your neighbor\u2019s Series 5 and see the time on the new always-on display? That\u2019s what someone did to me the other day on the subway. I\u2019m basically the Mother Teresa of giving people the time. Joking aside, if you bought last year\u2019s Apple Watch Series 4, I give you permission to stop reading. The biggest hardware change to this year\u2019s Series 5\u2014that always-on display\u2014is useful and cool. It just isn\u2019t a reason to ditch your Series 4. In fact, if you turn off the new display setting, you\u2019ll get slightly longer battery life. And unless you\u2019re a real outdoorsy person, I can\u2019t see the new compass being a reason, either. Plus, the new WatchOS 6 operating system, available for Series 3 and 4 now and later this fall for Series 1 and 2, adds a bunch of features that will make your old watch feel new. It\u2019s a different story if you\u2019re considering an Apple Watch for the first time, or upgrading from a Series 3 or earlier. Part fitness tracker, part health monitor, part daily minder and personal assistant, the Watch has evolved into a useful accessory. But given that the two-year-old Series 3 now costs $200\u2014half the price of the Series 5\u2014this year\u2019s buying decision comes down to how much money you\u2019d spend\u2026to possibly save your life. At least, that\u2019s how Apple is pitching it. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.) For Apple Watch owners, it has become muscle memory: Tap the screen\u2014even with your nose\u2014or lift your wrist to wake the display. The Series 5 allows you to break that habit, with a screen that always shows the time but dims nonvital information and graphics until you wake it up. Two technical changes allow the screen to be on all day without killing the battery: a new screen component that adjusts the refresh rate, along with optimized watch faces that go bare bones when not in use. Mickey Mouse, for instance, still points to the hour and minute, but stops tapping his foot to count out every second. Apple optimized all watch faces to support this. I\u2019ve already found the always-on helpful in some situations. When racing through the airport, for example, coffee in one hand, roller-bag handle in the other, I could glance down at my arm to see if I had time to grab a snack. When running, I found the dimmer, optimized version of the Workout app great for tracking my pace\u2014though bright sunlight made it harder to see. With the always-on display, I was able to make it through a full day\u20147 a.m. to 11 p.m.\u2014with just under 10% battery left. But when I disabled the always-on feature in settings, I had 30% remaining\u2014just like with my Series 4. (I have been testing the smaller 40mm model\u2014not the larger 44mm model.) I have so far used the trusty compass, enabled by the watch\u2019s new magnetometer, just once. I was coming out of the subway and wanted to make sure I was headed in the right direction. The Series 5 is, otherwise, just like the Series 4. And that\u2019s a great thing. The Series 4\u2019s bigger screen and health features made it the first watch I could confidently recommend to all. (If you weren\u2019t confused enough: The 4 is no longer on sale; Apple replaced it with the 5, which costs the same amount.) The upgrade from the 4 to 5 isn\u2019t going to be worth it for most, though. The big question is for new buyers of the Watch. Do you get the starting-at-$200 Series 3, or the starting-at-$400 Series 5? Both watches can run the new WatchOS 6 software, which is itself a big upgrade. It includes new watch faces, the ability to download apps right to the watch itself, track more fitness activities\u2014and menstrual cycles\u2014and alert you to dangerously loud noises. Oh, there\u2019s also, finally, a calculator, marking the official return of the \u201980s. Hardware-wise, the Series 3 has a smaller screen but is still water-resistant, and an able fitness tracker in its own right. The extra $200 for the Series 5 buys you a bigger, always-on screen, thinner design and better battery life\u2014plus more sophisticated health monitoring. The Series 5\u2019s ECG app records your heartbeat using an embedded electrical heart sensor and can check for atrial fibrillation (AFib). It also can detect falls and alert emergency contacts. I did some extensive testing of that last year and found it worked as promised. With those differences, and the $200 price delta, you\u2019re faced with an unusual gadget buying decision: How much are you willing to pay to save your life? Apple is even marketing the life-saving capabilities in videos like this. It feels a bit icky to have to make that decision. The Series 5 (like the Series 4) is another refinement of the best smartwatch you can buy. Unlike with earlier generations of the Apple Watch, I don\u2019t really wish it did something else or something better\u2014OK, maybe I do: \u2022The Apple Watch\u2019s battery can last all night long, yet unlike other popular fitness trackers like those from Fitbit, there is still no built-in sleep tracking. You can download sleep-tracking apps for the Apple Watch, but they are clunky. \u2022It still isn\u2019t possible to set up the Apple Watch or update its software without an iPhone. If you have a smartwatch, what\u2019s the primary reason you wear it\u2014health, fitness, time management, or something altogether different? Join the conversation below. \u2022The continued reliance on a magnetic charging disc requires you to travel with an extra, harder-to-replace cord. Why not charge with the same type of wireless charger that works with my iPhone and AirPods? \u2022Before heading out for a run, I was stuck syncing music and pairing AirPods with lots of taps and settings adjustments.

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is looking to make a splash in Hollywood by bringing feature-length films to theaters before releasing them on its streaming TV service, according to people familiar with the plans. The company has made overtures to cinema chains and consulted with an entertainment executive as it pursues a traditional theatrical-release plan that would keep its movies in theaters for weeks before becoming available on Apple TV+, these people said. Apple, by agreeing to give theaters an exclusive run of their movies, could show its features in major chains that require such terms and can handle a nationwide release. But given the art-house nature of some of Apple\u2019s films, the company might choose targeted rollouts in New York and Los Angeles. The iPhone maker is reaching out to theater-industry representatives now and plans to release films in cinemas first to draw big-name directors and producers and avoid the tension created by another Hollywood newcomer, Netflix Inc., people familiar with Apple\u2019s strategy said. Netflix typically asks theater owners to release movies it owns or produces at the same time they are available on the streaming service. That approach limits the company\u2019s ability to play its movies in major cinemas, which generally insist that films don\u2019t appear online for about three months after their theatrical debuts. In recent months, talks between theater companies and Netflix about showing awards contenders such as the coming Martin Scorsese drama \u201cThe Irishman\u201d in their cinemas have fallen apart after the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the exclusivity. Apple\u2019s strategy is more akin to that of Amazon.com Inc., which has given movies such as \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d a three-month theatrical window while others get a two-week run. The approach reflects the myriad trade-offs that tech and content giants are weighing as they position themselves in the competition for customers of their streaming services. Would you prefer to see Apple TV+ movies in theaters first and wait for them to be available at home later? Or would you prefer they be made available at home the day they debut? Why? Join the conversation below. Apple\u2019s effort is being led by its co-heads of video programming, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, who report to the company\u2019s services chief, Eddy Cue. They have tapped Greg Foster, the former head of entertainment at IMAX Corp. , as a consultant to help with the plan. Among Apple\u2019s first major theatrical releases is Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cOn the Rocks,\u201d which stars Rashida Jones as a young woman reconnecting with her eccentric father, to be played by Bill Murray. Apple is eyeing a mid-2020 release, perhaps following a premiere at a high-profile event such as the Cannes Film Festival, people familiar with the situation said. \u201cOn the Rocks\u201d is being produced through Apple\u2019s partnership with A24, an independent film production company known for such art-house releases as the best-picture winner \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cHereditary.\u201d Apple and A24 signed a multiyear partnership last year. A24, while well-regarded in Hollywood and among critics, isn\u2019t known for setting box-office records: Its top-grossing release, \u201cLady Bird,\u201d made $49 million in the U.S. and Canada. Apple has also talked with movie theater representatives about a documentary called \u201cThe Elephant Queen,\u201d which it plans to release this year. The documentary\u2014about an elephant leading her herd across Africa\u2014is slated to debut Nov. 1 on TV+ and also air in theaters so that it is eligible for awards consideration, according to people familiar with the plans. Rather than see the theatrical strategy as a moneymaker, Apple is more interested in the prestige and brand-building that can come with a glitzy theatrical release, according to people briefed on its plans, a strategy similar to that of Amazon Studios. Like Apple, Amazon has focused on character-driven movies largely abandoned by major studios, producing big-budget features in the vein of \u201cThe Avengers\u201d or \u201cThe Fast and the Furious.\u201d Apple has pitched itself as a place where artists can share their stories with the world, putting pressure on it to define a theatrical-release plan for producers and directors, said agents and Hollywood advisers. They said a strategy would help the company woo content creators who still want to see their work on the big screen. and be taken more seriously as a player in film. J.J. Abrams, the director of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d recently spurned Apple\u2019s overtures to bring his film, television and digital projects to the company. Instead, Mr. Abrams signed with WarnerMedia in a deal worth less than Apple proposed, partly because Apple didn\u2019t have a movie distribution model, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Movies could deepen the appeal of Apple TV+. Apple\u2019s subscription streaming service, which makes its debut Nov. 1, will initially offer just a handful of original shows, making it a tough sell against the deeper programming libraries of such streaming rivals as Netflix, Amazon and Walt Disney Co. Apple has tried to counter its shallower offering by undercutting rivals on price. TV+ will cost $4.99 a month, less than the $6.99 that Disney plans to charge for Disney+ and a fraction of the price of Netflix\u2019s fee of $12.99. The iPhone maker can afford to discount the service because of the profits it earns on hardware and its ability to distribute across the more than 1.4 billion active devices it has world-wide. Apple\u2019s push into Hollywood has created challenges for established players. On the day it announced its TV+ pricing, Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger resigned as a director on Apple\u2019s board to avoid potential conflicts. as the companies increasingly compete. Mr. Foster brings to Apple nearly two decades of experience with some of Hollywood\u2019s most popular filmmakers, such as James Cameron and Mr. Abrams, who have shot their movies with IMAX technology, as well as major exhibitors such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Mr. Foster\u2019s tenure at IMAX coincided with the company\u2019s expansion beyond science-museum documentaries to include auditoriums in every major theater chain. , dedicated to showing Hollywood\u2019s biggest releases for a premium price on large-format screens. Since IMAX only shows one movie at a time, studios now schedule their releases at times they know can secure IMAX auditoriums. \u2014Joe Flint contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said it is keeping production of its new Mac Pro in Texas, reversing earlier plans to shift assembly of the computer to China. The decision follows the Trump administration\u2019s move last week to grant tariff exemptions on 10 items Apple imports from China. The exclusions for components, including a power supply and a logic board, cover a period from September of last year to August 2020, and the U.S. will refund tariffs already paid. The tech giant had earlier tapped Taiwanese contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to assemble the nearly $6,000 desktop computer outside Shanghai. The high-end computer, which was introduced in 2013, had been assembled in Austin, Texas, by contractor Flex Ltd. and was touted as Apple\u2019s only Made in USA product. \u201cWe thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, in a statement Monday. Flex declined comment on Apple\u2019s announcement. Does the Trump administration\u2019s decision to waive some tariffs on Apple products show favoritism to a specific company, or was it a smart economic move? Why? Join the conversation below. Escalating trade tensions over the summer challenged Apple\u2019s plans to make the product in China, where labor and logistics costs are lower than in the U.S. In August, President Trump said he planned to extend tariffs of 10% to essentially all Chinese imports in December and raise tariffs on items already subject to duties. The tariffs could have cut into Apple\u2019s profits or forced it to increase the cost of the Mac Pro. The parts for which Apple obtained exemptions are critical to the computer\u2019s function. For example, Apple received a tariff waiver on the Mac Pro\u2019s graphics-processing module, which itself incorporates more than 1,600 components and allows images to be rendered on a computer screen, according to documents filed with the U.S. Trade Representative. Tariff exemptions were also granted on Apple accessories like the wireless mouse and trackpad, named Magic Mouse 2 and the Magic Trackpad. Apple\u2019s decision to reverse course and instead keep the computer\u2019s assembly in Texas is among the most pronounced examples of how tariffs have roiled corporate decision-making. Former operations employees and current suppliers say they have spent much of the past year evaluating contingency plans for products that are assembled in China, as the company looks to avoid tariffs. Apple had asked suppliers to move as much as a third of production for some devices outside China. The company said it would begin production of the new Mac Pro soon at the Texas facility, without specifying a date. The new desktop computer will include components designed and made by more than a dozen U.S. companies. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in a statement said he was grateful for Apple\u2019s investment and that the move was a testament to the state\u2019s workforce and business climate. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company revealed plans last year to spend $1 billion to build a new campus in Austin for 5,000 employees, expanding its footprint in the region. Apple also said it is on track to fulfill its commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. economy by 2023, last year spending more than $60 billion with more than 9,000 domestic suppliers. During an earnings call July 30, Mr. Cook told analysts that Apple was seeking exclusions for China-made components so it could continue assembling some Mac Pros in the U.S. \u201cThe vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere,\u201d Mr. Cook said, noting that components came from the U.S., China, Japan and South Korea. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of a global supply chain.\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration has given Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% a reprieve from tariffs on 10 items, including a power supply and a logic board, that are imported from China. They were among the $200 billion worth of Chinese imports first targeted for tariffs in September 2018. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on Friday granted Apple exemptions on its Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2 and various internal components. The exclusions cover a time period from September 2018 to August 2020, and the U.S. will refund tariffs already paid. The exclusions do not apply to other Apple items facing tariffs later this year, such as the Apple Watch, iPhones or AirPods, although the tech giant may seek more exemptions in the future. The dollar value of the exemptions couldn\u2019t be determined. Such parts imported from China are subject to tariffs of 25% of their value with the levies scheduled to rise to 30% on Oct. 15. Five other Apple exemption requests, including power and data cables and a circuit board, are still under review, according to the USTR. During an earnings call July 30, Tim Cook told analysts that Apple was seeking the exclusions so it could continue assembling some Mac Pros in the U.S. as it began doing with a version launched in 2013. Various parts for the Mac Pro are made in China. \u201cWe\u2019re explaining that and hope for a positive outcome,\u201d he said of the tariff exclusion process. An Apple spokesman declined to comment further. In seeking individual exclusions, the company said, \u201cThere are no other sources for this proprietary, Apple-designed component.\u201d A few days before Mr. Cook\u2019s comments, President Trump tweeted: \u201cApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear if any of Friday\u2019s exclusions relate to a new Mac Pro Apple revealed in June or an older model made in Austin, Texas, since 2013. The company planned to assemble the new Mac Pro, which is slated for release later this year, in China, using Taiwanese manufacturer Quanta Computer Inc. It also was making contingency plans to shift production elsewhere, if needed, because of U.S. tariffs. The USTR didn\u2019t say why it granted the specific exemptions Friday. The trade representative\u2019s office has been granting exclusions on a rolling basis for over a year. Only at the end of June could companies apply for relief from the tranche of tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods that took effect in September 2018. The levies were initially set at 10%. But as trade relations with Beijing deteriorated this year, the U.S. raised those tariffs to 25%. On Friday, the USTR granted exceptions on more than 400 items, primarily applications that had been filed on earlier tranches of tariffs. Other items granted reprieves included some familiar to consumers, such as miniature Christmas tree light sets and retractable dog leashes. Other exemptions included highly specific and obscure chemicals. \u2014Tripp Mickle in San Francisco and Chad Day in Washington contributed to this article.",

        "content": "It\u2019s time to play Pick a Door to Your Apps\u2014a game show that, admittedly, not many people would watch. Behind Door No. 1: That familiar username box and a never-ending hamster wheel of reused passwords and reset emails. Door No. 2: A quick login accompanied by a lifetime supply of intrusive ads. Door No. 3? A more private way in. Just be warned\u2014for now, Door No. 3 is hard to find. I\u2019m talking, of course, about the sign-in screen on all favorite apps. You can either log in with username and password, or choose a gateway manned by Facebook, Google or\u2014soon, in some cases\u2014 Apple. AAPL 0.85% In an attempt to unseat its ad-powered competitors, Apple is offering a privacy-focused app sign-in service with the arrival on Thursday of iOS 13. What you might not have realized about those other highly convenient sign-in buttons is that your personal information can be shared behind the scenes and used to track you. Heck, there was a time when I didn\u2019t know that myself. When I first signed up for Spotify using Facebook, I unknowingly opted to share my email address, my friends list and my birthday. That\u2019s a lot of info, just to listen to my Acoustic Covers playlist. Apple, on the other hand, has engineered its button so you share less with app makers. You can even create a disposable email address. After testing out Apple\u2019s new feature in some early supported apps, I can tell you it\u2019s the best option\u2014if any of the apps you use actually add it. Apple is coming from far behind, and facing some pushback from app makers that rely on those incumbents not just for marketing, but for security. Until more companies adopt this, Apple\u2019s greatest contribution here is to make us question why companies provide these \u201csingle sign-on\u201d services, and what we get in return. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.) When choosing a door into an app, you either take responsibility for your own username and password, or trust one of the big-tech companies to handle the authenticating for you. If you choose the latter, you just log in with your Facebook/Google/Apple credentials and they confirm you are who you say you are\u2014often using two-factor authentication, where you scan your fingerprint or face, or enter a secret code sent via text or app. Then they give the app a thumbs-up, without sharing your password. (See the video for a more colorful explanation\u2014which also involves doors.) If you use strong, unique passwords and store them in a password manager, as I\u2019ve long suggested, you might be fine creating a fresh account for every app and service. Even then, security experts make a case for logging in via a big tech company. For one thing, they have larger divisions dedicated to security. They can troubleshoot issues that smaller companies might not be able to tackle. Also, smaller companies can\u2019t always implement two-factor authentication, a baseline requirement these days. Even the simplest personal information, like an email address, can be used to track you from app to app or website to website. At a minimum, Google shares your profile photo, name and email address with the app makers using its single sign-on options. Facebook requires you share to your profile photo and full name. Apps that use Facebook often ask for even more. Take Tinder. Log in and it asks for access to your Facebook friends list, birthday, photos, page likes and email address. There\u2019s a panel to adjust the sharing options, but all of the permissions are turned on by default. Mark Risher, senior director of product management for Google Account, says the company provides this service to help secure the Internet. (It certainly also makes it easier for Google to provide its other services, from Gmail to search.) Mr. Risher says the company doesn\u2019t use this collected information to target ads. But Facebook does. Facebook Login \u201callows businesses to create custom audiences of people who have visited their properties. That way a business can show ads to people on Facebook who have visited their sites and apps,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said. Even if you don\u2019t mind Facebook profiting off of your internet behavior, the company has a history of misusing data and leaking it to outsiders, in the case of Cambridge Analytica and in many others. (The company updated its data policies last year in response.) And then there are the breaches: In 2018, a Facebook data breach was tied to its single sign-on tool. Like Google, Apple shares your name and email address with the app, but it gives you an option to hide your email or change your name: It will share an anonymized email address and then forward any email from the app maker to your real address. The Bird bike and scooter app thinks my email is 636r6zf9kz@privaterelay.appleid.com ... and my name is Scooby Doo. Developers can implement the Sign in with Apple button on Mac apps and on websites as well. While Apple has taken on the superhero role of big tech\u2019s privacy protector, this is less altruism, more shrewd marketing: The more you trust Apple, the more you keep buying its devices and using its apps\u2014many of which now charge monthly subscriptions. The number of popular apps using this new Apple tool so far is small. I tested the feature in Bird and the family photo journal app Lifecake. Kayak, Nike, Instacart and LoseIt are also among the apps Apple confirmed to be implementing Sign in with Apple this fall. When I contacted other top iOS app makers\u2014those which use Facebook and/or Google sign-in buttons\u2014some including Postmates and Venmo said they had no plans yet to add the feature. Others, including TikTok, Evernote and Todoist, said it was on the road map. Pinterest said it is in touch with Apple, but wouldn\u2019t comment further. Spotify declined to comment. Apple\u2019s newest developer guidelines require any apps that offer a social sign-in to also implement Sign in with Apple. As of last week, new apps submitted must offer the button. Existing apps and app updates must follow by April 2020. In cases like Tinder\u2019s, the anonymity benefit to one user can be a problem for other users. \u201cVerifying a user\u2019s identity using their login credentials helps us prevent those who have been removed for their conduct from accessing our service,\u201d a Tinder spokesman said, adding that the company looks forward to hearing more from Apple on this. Do you prefer signing in to apps with a username and password, or letting Facebook or Google sign in for you? Why? Join the conversation below. There\u2019s also the fact that the iPhone isn\u2019t immune to security vulnerabilities. Plus, who could forget the iCloud celebrity hacks of 2014? Apple does require two-factor for Sign in with Apple. And finally, even when your favorite app does adopt it, you might have to create a new account to use it. I wish more app makers would run\u2014not walk\u2014to implement Apple\u2019s option as an alternative to Facebook and Google. For now, just be on the lookout for it. If you don\u2019t see it, I recommend Google as the quickest, safest alternative. Just do yourself a favor, and choose your doors wisely. \u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

The move into higher-quality audio\u2014at a higher price\u2014is a sign of the music-streaming market\u2019s maturation, say music industry executives, who have called for different forms of subscriptions beyond the standard $9.99-a-month offerings from Spotify Technology SA SPOT 0.79% and Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% Other services including Tidal offer high-definition sound, but they tend to market to a niche, audiophile audience. Now Amazon Music, the No. 3 music-streaming service by subscriptions, envisions bringing better sound quality to the masses. At $12.99 a month for Prime members and $14.99 a month for nonmembers, Amazon Music HD is intended to be more affordable than comparable services such as one from Tidal, which costs $19.99 a month. Do you think higher-quality sound will be an advantage for Amazon Music as it competes with Spotify and Apple Music? Join the conversation below. Music streaming has become mainstream\u2014accounting for 80% of revenue from recorded music, according to an industry trade group. But in getting there, audio quality has suffered, says Steve Boom, Amazon\u2019s vice president for music. Enough customers now see audio quality as important enough that they will pay for it, so the move into the market is worth it, he said. \u201cThis is the next wave in music streaming,\u201d Mr. Boom said. The new tier, available Tuesday in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan, has more than 50 million audio tracks in CD-quality high definition and what the company describes as millions of tracks in even-higher-quality \u201cUltra-HD.\u201d Amazon\u2019s Ultra-HD is comparable to Tidal\u2019s \u201cMasters,\u201d which both promise better sound quality than CD. Tidal offers about 60 audio million tracks, including more than 170,000 at \u201cMasters\u201d quality. Since the emergence of the CD\u2014the first popular digital format\u2014in the 1980s, there has been a running tension between convenience and audio quality\u2014a dynamic that has only intensified with the emergence of digital downloads and streaming. Some audiophiles complained that early CDs, in particular, suffered from poorer sound quality than vinyl records. Many still believe CDs, downloads and streams sound worse than vinyl. \u201cWe all have 50 million songs at the tip of our fingers and music\u2019s never been more convenient than it is today,\u201d Mr. Boom said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been lost in that march forward has been this sacrifice in audio quality.\u201d Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose how many music subscribers it has but people familiar with the matter said it recently had more than 34 million, which include a $9.99-a-month Amazon Music Unlimited service and the more limited Prime Music, which comes included with Prime memberships. Spotify leads globally, with 108 million, followed by Apple Music with more than 60 million. Tidal most recently disclosed its subscriber counts in 2016, when it said it had three million subscribers overall, 45% of whom paid for its HD service. At that time, Spotify said it had 30 million paying subscribers and Apple Music had 11 million. Record business executives are more optimistic about Amazon\u2019s prospects with high-definition audio, especially as it taps its appeal to the mainstream. The new tier has earned the approval of rocker Neil Young, who has advocated for higher-quality audio since the introduction of digital music\u2014even launching a high-resolution streaming service for his own music last year. \u201cThis will be the biggest thing to happen in music since the introduction of digital audio 40 years ago,\u201d he said in a statement provided by Amazon.",

        "content": "This year I\u2019ve written two iPhone reviews. This one has my testing results of the new iPhone 11 models. The other, found here, is an advice column for the many readers we\u2019ve heard from who have older phones\u2014I\u2019m looking at you, iPhone Sixers! One day, I\u2019ll tell my grandchildren of a time before the iPhone 11. I\u2019ll regale them with stories of portable chargers the size of cinder blocks strapped to the backs of our phones. I\u2019ll tell them how we scoured walls in search of power outlets. I\u2019ll describe the panic that set in when the red empty-battery icon dipped below 5%. In the scheme of iPhone upgrade history, the new iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max sure seem boring. Same designs\u2026but new colors! Cameras\u2026but three of them! Glass\u2026but stronger?! After a week of testing, I can tell you that\u2019s mostly just smoke-and-mirrors marketing, except for one thing many of us have wanted all along: phones that are a bit heavier and thicker\u2014but work when we damn well need them to. Yes, longer battery life. If you haven\u2019t been following along, here\u2019s the lineup, which arrives Friday: \u2022 iPhone 11 ($699 and up): An upgrade to last year\u2019s iPhone XR, it has a 6.1-inch screen that covers the whole front (no fingerprint sensor) and two cameras on the back. The LCD screen isn\u2019t as nice as the OLED on the pricier models, but I promise you won\u2019t even think about it. \u2022 iPhone 11 Pro ($999 and up): The smallest of the bunch with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, it now has three cameras on the back. \u2022 iPhone 11 Pro Max ($1,099 and up): Identical to the 11 Pro, save for a 6.5-inch screen. Apple has been talking up these phones\u2019 cameras, and it\u2019s true: If you enjoy taking pictures, especially of kids or pets, they do have some great tricks. The wide-angle camera is sure to have people mistaking me for Ansel Adams. The newly added night mode, while a bit buggy, is an improvement over previous dimly lit, washed-out shots. Now, as we review my key findings, promise me you\u2019ll follow my annual advice: Regardless of what you\u2019re upgrading from, choose which features matter to you most, and try to ignore Apple\u2019s marketing machine. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Last year, I upgraded to the iPhone XR purely for its all-day battery life. After my daily routine of quite-heavy phone use, I have about 5% to 10% still remaining by my 11:30 p.m. bedtime\u2014with no extra charging during the day. All three new iPhones met or exceeded that in my real-world use. However, my video streaming tests didn\u2019t always show as big of a leap in battery life as my actual usage\u2014nor as big as Apple\u2019s battery-life claims. Battery testing is a tricky thing. Between screen-brightness settings and our countless app options, we all use our phones differently. Here are my notes on all three phones. iPhone 11: In my full day using the 11 as my primary phone (email, a lot of Twitter and texting, phone calls, too much tapping through Instagram), I was left with a 15% charge by 11:30 p.m. The iPhone 11 streamed video on YouTube for 13 hours and 20 minutes\u2014about 20 minutes longer than the XR. (Apple promises an extra hour of battery life.) iPhone 11 Pro: With the 11 Pro as my primary phone, I was left with just under a 10% charge at 11 p.m. That\u2019s far longer than I used to get with the X but not as long as with the 11. The 11 Pro streamed video on YouTube for 13 hours\u2014three hours longer than the XS. iPhone 11 Pro Max: On 11 Pro Max battery-testing day, I was left with a roughly 20% charge by lights out. I could go to sleep and wake up with enough juice to get me through the morning. Even after a grueling day of camera testing at the New York Renaissance Faire, it had 25% left, while the other two were in the dreaded 10% territory. Why are the Pro phones lasting so much longer? The screen and processor are more power efficient, but they also have bigger batteries\u2014part of the reason they\u2019re a fraction of an ounce heavier and 0.02 inches thicker. Miracles happen, my friends. After more than a decade of including the rinky-dink five-watt charging cube in the box, the Pros finally include faster 18-watt chargers. They went from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes. After snapping 1,000 photos in over a dozen settings with a bevy of smartphones\u2014the new models, older iPhones and even some Android competitors\u2014here\u2019s my assessment of the new camera features. Wide shots: How hard is it to just step back for a wider shot? That was my thought when I heard Apple was adding a wide-angle lens to the iPhones. I was wrong. I found myself using the ultra-wide-angle lens on all three phones all the time. Landscapes look great but so do tighter shots\u2014like one of my son standing in the hallway, which looked like the work of an artist, with minimal fisheye distortion. Night mode: In low-light situations (a dark restaurant, a night flight), the camera automatically goes into night mode, indicated by a little yellow icon. Snap a photo and it prompts you to hold still for a few seconds. In the background, the camera system gathers multiple images and then forms a brighter, crisper shot than you\u2019d get in regular shooting. It feels like a magic trick, and I ended up taking pretty impressive illuminated shots. But the Google Pixel 3\u2019s Night Sight mode produced low-light photos that were often even better. I also learned two important things: to tell my subjects to freeze like mannequins, and to hold my breath so I don\u2019t move during the pause. Movement can cause funky light streaks. That\u2019s why I wish the feature were easier to disable. Plus, the new sensors in the wide-angle camera improve regular low-light shots, too. (Night mode and the camera app also froze from time to time\u2014one of several iOS 13 bugs I encountered during my tests.) Portrait mode: For the most part, portrait mode\u2014where the phone artfully blurs the background\u2014looks the same as it has for years. It doesn\u2019t always blur edges perfectly, but it\u2019s a nice option. On the iPhone 11 Pro, you now have a choice of shooting portrait mode with the wide or telephoto lenses. On the basic iPhone 11, it\u2019s only available on the standard wide-angle lens. But unlike the XR, the 11 now lets you shoot portrait mode with your favorite pet. I can confirm it works with dogs and birds alike. Video: If you shoot a lot of video, you\u2019ll notice improved stabilization. At the Renaissance Faire, I handed the iPhone 11 Pro Max and the older iPhone XS Max to a knight on horseback for a joust. Both shots are still bouncy, but the Pro\u2019s footage is smoother and easier to watch. Perhaps even more significant, you can finally switch lenses for shooting. Zooming in and out, from one lens to another, is smooth, but I did find the cameras sometimes struggled to quickly refocus. What were your initial thoughts about the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro, and has reading this review changed them? Join the conversation below. Battery and camera weren\u2019t the only iPhone 11 highlights, though they were certainly the biggest. I didn\u2019t really test the added water and dust resistance, but I did discover one thing by accident: The supposedly more durable glass still isn\u2019t scratch resistant. When I carried two iPhones together during a shoot, the cameras on one rubbed against the screen of another, causing some permanent scratches. Best advice: Don\u2019t carry two iPhones at once. As for your buying decision, with its price-to-feature ratio, the $700 iPhone 11 has the broadest appeal. However, there are far more choices than just these three phones, as I cover in my other column. Last year\u2019s XR is now a great value at $600. If you\u2019re a photography nut and are OK spending over $1,000 for the absolute best, the Pros are there for you. Just don\u2019t be mad when next year\u2019s iPhones\u2014potentially with 5G connectivity\u2014blow them away. Heck, you could also buy the Pro Max, just so you can tell your grandchildren about the iPhone that finally lasted more than a day on a single charge. \u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.",

        "content": "Walt Disney Co. \u2019s Chief Executive Robert Iger resigned from Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s board of directors, the tech giant said on Friday, severing a yearslong connection between the two companies as they prepare to launch competing video-streaming services. He resigned on Tuesday, Apple said in a one-sentence filing to securities regulators. Mr. Iger, who has led Disney as CEO since 2005, joined Apple\u2019s board in 2012 and was serving as the nominating-committee chair and on the compensation committee. He had a close relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, born out of the 2006 sale of Pixar Animation Studios to Disney. Mr. Jobs was Pixar\u2019s chairman. The resignation came on the day Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook announced a $4.99 monthly price for its streaming service, Apple TV+, and said it would become available on Nov. 1. The price undercut Disney\u2019s plan to charge $6.99 for its Disney+ service, also coming in November. Apple\u2019s filing gave no reason for Mr. Iger\u2019s departure. In a statement, the company called him \u201ca dedicated, visionary CEO and a role model for an entire generation of business leaders.\u201d \u201cWhile we will greatly miss his contributions as a board member, we respect his decision, and we have every expectation that our relationship with Bob and Disney will continue far into the future,\u201d Apple\u2019s statement said. Mr. Iger said in a statement that his time on the Apple board was an \u201cextraordinary privilege.\u201d He added: \u201cI have the utmost respect for Tim Cook, his team at Apple, and for my fellow board members.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify why he resigned. Apple\u2019s price for TV+ was widely seen as an attempt to catch up with established media competitors, including Disney and Netflix Inc., in the intensifying streaming wars and compensate for its smaller programming library. Apple plans to launch TV+ with a handful of original shows, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a drama about a morning TV news show that stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The tech giant also will try to leverage its huge existing customer base, with more than 1.4 billion devices in use world-wide. The two companies\u2019 plans to launch competing subscription-video services made it difficult for Mr. Iger to remain on the Apple board, according to a person familiar with Mr. Iger\u2019s thinking. \u201cApple\u2019s got a broader role in the media landscape,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe\u2019s reached the conclusion that there are a growing number of issues that will come up before the board that will limit his ability to fully engage and participate as a board member.\u201d Apple TV+ is a much smaller part of the tech giant\u2019s overall portfolio. But remaining on the Apple board could have created at least the perception of a conflict of interest, regardless of how much or little board time was dedicated to the subject. Mr. Iger told Bloomberg Television in April that he was in a \u201cconstant dialogue about making sure I\u2019m not doing anything\u201d that would conflict with \u201cwhat an Apple board member would do.\u201d He added the Apple streaming business was \u201cnascent\u201d and \u201crelatively small,\u201d so it wasn\u2019t discussed much at that time. Mr. Iger has repeatedly described Disney+ as central to his company\u2019s future, as consumers give up cable-television packages in favor of streaming-service bundles of their own creation. The company\u2019s $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets was largely a bid to amass content to make Disney+ a viable competitor to Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s Prime video service. Disney\u2019s $6.99 month price for its streaming service is itself significantly less than Netflix, which costs $12.99 a month for its standard option. Disney plans to offer Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel movie titles on the service, as well as a slew of original series and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d along with other shows and movies which it acquired in the Fox deal earlier this year.",

        "content": "Congress opened a new front in the government\u2019s antitrust probe of giant technology firms, with House lawmakers on Friday demanding emails and other records from some of the industry\u2019s top chief executives as they look for evidence of anticompetitive behavior. The requests from House Judiciary Committee leaders from both parties to Amazon.com Inc., AMZN 0.55% Facebook Inc., FB 0.69% Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% and Alphabet Inc., GOOG 0.03% owner of Google, set up potential conflicts between tech leaders protective of their business tactics and lawmakers who want to scour their corporate records. Among other requests, the committee asked the firms to provide by Oct. 14 reams of documents, including executive communications and financial statements as well as information about competitors, market share, mergers and key business decisions. The dozens of executives named in the requests include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google\u2019s early leaders Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt. The companies are likely to resist such carte blanche access, which could set in motion negotiations with the House committee over the scope of materials provided, said William Kovacic, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIf you want everything, everything will take a long time,\u201d said Mr. Kovacic, who is now a George Washington University professor. The next step will be \u201cintense negotiations between the companies and the committee about what will be produced,\u201d he said. The House committee isn\u2019t subpoenaing the records, though it has the authority to do so\u2014a fact that gives lawmakers a stick they can use in negotiations over access. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the requests will aid an investigation, begun on June 3, into \u201cgrowing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications.\u201d Do you feel the big tech companies wield too much power? If so, what needs to change? Join the conversation below. \u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring,\u201d said Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.), the panel\u2019s top Republican. The letters were also signed by Reps. David Cicilline (D., R.I.) and Jim Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), the two senior members of the panel\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust issues. The companies didn\u2019t comment Friday. All four firms have previously said they provide significant benefits to consumers and face significant competition. They have expressed willingness to work with authorities. The congressional probe adds to scrutiny of the tech giants, which already face a broad antitrust review by the Justice Department that could lead to formal investigations. The department has asked Google for information about previous antitrust probes by other agencies. The Federal Trade Commission, the other top U.S. antitrust enforcer, has opened an investigation of Facebook, with an early focus on its key acquisitions, and is questioning third-party sellers who use Amazon\u2019s marketplace. FTC Chair Joseph Simons declined to comment Friday on the House letters. State attorneys general from both parties recently launched probes of Google, with an early focus on its advertising business, and Facebook. Authorities in other countries are also investigating. Officials have said they would work together on the overlapping probes, although the extent of that cooperation isn\u2019t known. U.S. sanctions against the companies, if they come at all, are likely to be years away and imposed by federal or state enforcers rather than Congress. Lawmakers can find facts and change laws, but not bring enforcement actions. The House probe represents a threat to the firms, even if it doesn\u2019t result in changes to antitrust laws. Documents released to lawmakers could become public and serve as justification to summon top executives to high-profile hearings. That would create risks to the companies\u2019 reputations and could fuel political pressure for a regulatory crackdown. The House panel\u2019s detailed information requests also provide hints as to how authorities could try to build an antitrust case against the firms: \u2014The request to Alphabet targets 24 products and services, from advertising technology to YouTube and the Waze navigation app, seeking executives\u2019 communications regarding acquisitions and how other businesses interact with Google\u2019s own services. \u2014The lawmakers asked Amazon to provide executive communications related to product searches on Amazon.com and the pricing of Amazon Prime as well as fees charged to sellers. \u2014Apple was asked for executives\u2019 emails about search rankings in its App Store, whether Apple has discussed copying some third-party apps and the company\u2019s policy on requiring that apps use Apple\u2019s payment systems for purchases, an issue raised by Spotify Technology SA in an antitrust complaint in Europe. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple routinely lists apps ahead of competitors though the company\u2019s apps skirt its own rules for rankings. Apple, which takes a 30% cut from most apps it sells, has said the App Store encourages competition and that its cut is justified by the work its staff does reviewing apps to protect consumers from malware or other threats. Its apps account for a small fraction of those available on the store, and it collects money from only 16% of the 2 million apps available. \u2014Facebook received questions about its executives\u2019 discussions around the acquisitions of WhatsApp, Instagram, and the data-security app Onavo, as well as decisions related to which third-party apps access its social-media platform. Big tech companies have ramped up spending to influence the new antitrust discourse, as well as other policy debates, none more so than Google. It is a funder of at least 33 nonprofit groups that are active in the antitrust debate across the political spectrum, according to its public policy transparency reports. Google is also a financial supporter of minority lawmaker groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. It has given substantial sums to state attorneys general groups over the last decade or so, including more than $450,000 to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and more than $250,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, according to data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics. Its Google NetPAC contributed about $1.9 million to federal candidates and committees in the 2017-2018 election cycle, according to federal data, compared with about $1.8 million for Amazon\u2019s PAC and about $721,000 for Facebook\u2019s. Amazon leads the group in spending for the 2020 election to date. Apple doesn\u2019t have a PAC. Amazon in 2017 gave $12,500 each to the Democratic and Republican attorneys general associations. For 2018 it bumped that up to $50,000 each Staffers on the Judiciary Committee are simultaneously dealing with other time-consuming issues, most notably potential impeachment proceedings. That said, the bipartisan nature of Friday\u2019s letters reflects broad support for the probe. \u201cBipartisan consensus sends a clear statement to regulators that this isn\u2019t just one side\u2019s sour grapes,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen Inc. Mr. Gallant noted that internal emails discussing stifling competition at Microsoft Corp. became an issue during that firm\u2019s time under the antitrust microscope two decades ago. \u201cThis is Congress\u2019 backstage pass. They will be able to see what company management said privately about the way they designed their business and about whether that was actually anti-competitive,\u201d Mr. Gallant said. Congress has a history of going after emails, although those from top-level executives tend to be less revelatory because cautious higher-ranking people typically send few such online communications, investigators have found. In 2010, Senate investigators released an email from then-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in which he appeared to acknowledge that the firm dodged a bullet in the financial crisis by betting on a market decline through taking \u201cshort\u201d positions. But generally, emails from lower-level employees have led to more criticism. A 2010 probe of the BP PLC oil spill made headlines when a lower-level employee said in an email \u201cwho cares\u201d about a shortage of parts on a drilling rig before it exploded. In the General Motors Co. ignition-switch crisis, the company pinned the blame largely on a single engineer who received emails warning him of problems. This isn\u2019t the first time that Congress has probed whether large tech companies are stifling competition. In 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee hauled Mr. Schmidt, former Google Inc. executive chairman, for questioning related to whether the company was abusing its dominance of online searches by steering users toward its own services at the expense of rivals. But he emerged largely unscathed, and amid a weak recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression, Congress had little appetite to pursue a probe into a driver of the U.S. economy. Here\u2019s a look at the investigations into big technology companies",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% appeared to make a very un-Apple-like move with the low price of its coming TV streaming service. The iPhone maker actually had little choice. At its event Tuesday used mainly to showcase this year\u2019s new devices, Apple also announced pricing and launch details for its TV+ offering. The service will launch on Nov. 1 for $4.99 a month, though a year of it will be included free for anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod Touch. That puts Apple\u2019s TV+ about 44% below the cheapest offering from Netflix and about 29% below the planned launch price of Disney+, which itself drew attention for aggressive pricing. But the services aren\u2019t really comparable. Streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com offer their own self-produced content as well as a wide range of shows and movies licensed from Hollywood studios. Disney owns one of the strongest libraries in the business that includes the \u201cStar Wars\u201d and Marvel properties. By contrast, Apple\u2019s service will be limited to its own shows. Some of those will debut with the service in November, including a sci-fi series called \u201cSee\u201d starring \u201cAquaman\u201d star Jason Momoa and a dramatic series starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Others will come later. Apple is certainly sparing no expense; each episode of \u201cSee\u201d is costing the company nearly $15 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. But Apple is still very late to streaming, and commanding a premium price for a limited service of unknown quality was always going to be a stretch. A bigger question is how TV+ will affect Apple\u2019s overall business. The low price and first-year giveaway means it will likely provide little near-term lift to the company\u2019s vital service revenue stream. The high cost of its programming also means it will offer little-to-no contribution to service gross margins, which typically are higher than the corporate average. But the tie-in with new devices could end up helping sales of those products\u2014and build an audience base that will stick around after the first year if they like what they see. Regardless, it will take some time before Apple\u2019s streaming service proves itself a blockbuster.",

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: A Monthly Subscription to Apple\u2019s TV Service Costs $4.99 To buyers of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac, the service will be free for a year. The new push into streaming was announced on Tuesday. It means that Apple will be going head-to-head against the likes of Netflix. The price for Apple\u2019s service is much cheaper than the standard monthly charge for Netflix. But Apple\u2019s service may not be as attractive to consumers, at least not yet. Consider the number of shows being offered. Apple identified nine shows that will be available on Apple TV+ come Nov. 1. Netflix offers some 5,800 shows and movies. That\u2019s compared with 64 for the same month a year ago. The aerospace company is heading for its lowest annual total of deliveries in eight years. Boeing is still struggling with regulatory scrutiny and with competition in the aftermath of two crashes of 737 MAX passenger airplanes that killed a total of 346 people. Boeing\u2019s stock has yet to recover from a selloff in March, when the 737 MAX was grounded. Deliveries of jetliners are expected to revive next year\u2014when the 737 MAX may be back. The decline came after Wendy\u2019s announced that it will be investing $20 million and hiring new employees. Those moves led the company to lower its forecast for earnings this year. The fast-food chain said it plans to pump the money into offering breakfast at its restaurants nationwide next year. The company had previously tried a national breakfast menu\u2014but without much success. An analyst at Guggenheim says the decision to compete on breakfast \u201cadded risk to shares.\u201d Numbers by Barron\u2019s is our daily podcast. Find out more here.",

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif.\u2014 Apple Inc. revealed a trio of upgraded iPhones, including a lower-priced model, and detailed its plans to enter the increasingly competitive video-streaming market with an offering that is cheaper than rivals. The announcements came Tuesday at Apple\u2019s marquee product showcase, where this year the tech giant sought to balance its penchant for premium products with an emphasis on value. Apple is looking to offset slowing hardware sales by selling newer services, such as TV streaming, videogames and news\u2014and it is being aggressive on pricing to gain a foothold in those cutthroat industries. Apple set monthly prices for its TV+ video-streaming service and Arcade videogame-streaming service at $4.99, largely undercutting rivals. TV+ comes free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac, a perk that could get more people to buy a new device or upgrade. Apple can afford to discount the services because of the profits it earns on hardware and its distribution edge over competitors, with more than 1.4 billion devices in use world-wide. The company is making just a handful of shows available for the TV+ debut in November, so the service will be a tough sell against the deeper programming catalogs offered by streaming rivals Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. But at $4.99 a month, TV+ is much cheaper than Netflix\u2019s $12.99 monthly standard option and Disney\u2019s $6.99 monthly fee for a service expected to arrive in November. \u201cClearly, they want their customers to use it and not feel forced to choose between it and Netflix or Hulu,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. She added that Apple could offer lower prices on services without affecting its historical brand position in hardware as a luxury-device maker. Netflix doesn\u2019t see the low prices as a threat, because they make it more likely Netflix customers won\u2019t be forced into a choice if they want to add another streaming service, an executive familiar with the company\u2019s strategy said. At Tuesday\u2019s event\u2014held in the Steve Jobs Theater, the on-campus auditorium named after Apple\u2019s co-founder\u2014Apple lavished much of its time on the flagship device that Mr. Jobs helped create a dozen years ago. The new but familiar-looking iPhones, now under the iPhone 11 brand, blended standard updates such as longer-lasting batteries and new colors with more innovative features such as a night mode for low-light photos and the ability to shoot video by holding down the camera button. Apple lowered the price of its most popular model by $50, countering three consecutive years of price increases. The iPhone 11, a 6.1-inch device that updates last year\u2019s XR model, will start at $699 and include a dual-rear camera. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, with triple-rear cameras, play to the premium market with prices of $999 and $1,099. Apple also introduced an updated smartwatch with improved power that allows it to display time throughout the day, and cut the price of an earlier model to its lowest point yet. The company didn\u2019t reveal any surprise new devices, delivering instead the type of incremental hardware improvements that have defined its events in recent years and stirred up questions about Apple\u2019s innovation prowess under Chief Executive Tim Cook. Mr. Jobs\u2019s successor has transformed Apple into one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies but hasn\u2019t delivered a megahit product on par with the iPhone, which arrived in 2007, or the iPad, first released in 2010, the year before Mr. Cook took over. The Apple Watch made its debut five years ago and has largely been a success, as have the more recent AirPods wireless earbuds, but not enough to shore up falling iPhone sales. Mr. Cook has since pushed Apple to leverage its hardware success to sell more software and services. TV+ will make its debut Nov. 1 with shows such as \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a drama about a morning talk show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Other shows will be added in the months afterward, Mr. Cook said. The watch and new subscription services are central to Apple\u2019s efforts to diversify its business as the iPhone falters. Its customers are holding on to current iPhones longer and bristling at prices of new models that average nearly $1,000. Those struggles are particularly acute in China, where Apple is battling increased competition, trade tensions and a decelerating economy. Apple also made the Apple Watch a better value, reducing the price of the Series 3 model about 30% to $199 and maintaining a price of $399 on its newest model, the Series 5. The smartwatch prices showed Apple is willing to eat the cost of tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers. The Apple Watch was among its first products subjected to the 15% tariffs the Trump administration introduced on $111 billion in Chinese-made goods this month. Apple can absorb the extra costs of tariffs without it affecting margins because memory prices have fallen in recent years, providing a cushion, analysts said. To sustain growth, Apple must squeeze more money out of existing customers by leveraging past hardware success to sell newer products and services. It has over 900 million iPhone users world-wide, but only a fraction own an Apple Watch or pay for the company\u2019s streaming-music service. It has rolled out several new accessories and services to deepen its reach into users\u2019 wallets, including its AirPods, a credit card and a videogame service called Arcade. The emphasis on services and newer products has coincided with several high-profile executive departures, including design chief Jony Ive, who will leave this year to start his own design firm. It has also revived questions about the company\u2019s ability to offer the type of hardware innovations that turned the iPhone into one of the world\u2019s best-selling products. \u201cApple isn\u2019t growing like they were before,\u201d said Mike Frazier, president of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, a Walnut Creek, Calif.-based firm with about $500 million under management that counted Apple as its largest holding before scaling back its investment this year. \u201cThey\u2019re a victim of their own success.\u201d Apple needs to encourage enough iPhone upgrades to avoid repeating the smartphone sales slump that dogged the company last year, forcing it to slash its revenue forecast in January for the first time in more than 15 years. World-wide sales of the company\u2019s smartphones fell 15% to $109.02 billion for the three quarters ended in June. Shipments have declined an estimated 17% over that period, according to analysts, outpacing the smartphone industry\u2019s projected decline of 2% this year. Do you plan on switching to any of the new iPhone models? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Wall Street has already begun to look ahead to next year\u2019s models that are expected to feature 5G, a faster fifth generation of wireless technology that will result in speedier smartphones. Apple will be lagging behind rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. in bringing that technology to market. \u201cThey will lose market share in China in the premium space without 5G because the country is going to ensure 5G is relevant,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cThat will trigger adoption of Huawei, Xiaomi and others and hurt Apple.\u201d Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. \u2014Amol Sharma contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% on Wednesday joined U.S. companies including Deere DE -0.12% & Co. and Walt Disney Co. in a recent sprint to issue new bonds, taking advantage of the steep decline in benchmark interest rates and a surge in investor demand. Apple launched its first bond deal since 2017, selling $7 billion of debt. All three companies issued 30-year bonds with yields below 3%, a first for the corporate debt market. Twenty-one companies with investment-grade credit ratings issued bonds totaling about $27 billion on Tuesday, said Andrew Karp, head of investment-grade capital markets at Bank of America Corp. \u201cThat\u2019s equivalent to a busy week for us\u2014in one day,\u201d he said. About 20 more companies were expected to issue investment-grade bonds Wednesday. The issuance boom is one consequence of a rally in debt that has driven down Treasury yields, which fall as bond prices rise, to near-record lows. Spurred by concerns that slowing growth and a mounting trade conflict will end the decadelong global economic expansion, investors have swept up government bonds around the world, pulling yields in many countries into negative territory. Bonds issued by name-brand corporations give investors a relatively safe alternative that still pays more than government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note\u2014which helps set borrowing costs for individuals, companies and state and local governments\u2014settled Wednesday at 1.456% compared with around 2% in July. The fall has dragged down corporate borrowing costs in lockstep, with the yield of Disney\u2019s bond due in 2046 sliding to 2.83% from 3.3% since the start of August, according to data from MarketAxess. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unbelievable that three 30-year corporate bonds were issued with sub 3% yields in the past 48 hours but with $17 trillion negative yielding debt out there, it makes sense,\u201d said Tom Murphy, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which manages $25 billion of investment-grade corporate bond investments. Coca-Cola Co. and health insurer Anthem Inc. also announced new bond sales Wednesday, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Kilroy Realty Corp. , a Los Angeles-based real-estate investment trust, or REIT, on Tuesday offered $500 million of senior notes maturing in 2030, with an interest rate of 3.050% a year. Timing was crucial for Tuesday\u2019s offering, said Tyler Rose, the company\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cWe decided to access the market on Tuesday to take advantage of an attractive all-in rate and to get ahead of the large supply of REIT debt that we understand is coming later this month,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cWe ended up with the lowest 10-year coupon in our history by a wide margin.\u201d The new batch of bonds is primarily being used to refinance near-term debt, helping companies lower their interest expenses by replacing existing debt with lower yielding bonds. The bond boom is the corporate version of the refinancing rush that hit the mortgage market last month as homeowners moved to lock in cheaper loans. Blackstone Group was able to reduce the coupon for a 10-year bond maturing in 2021 by more than half, Chief Financial Officer Michael Chae said. The company sold $900 million in bonds on Tuesday and some of the proceeds will be used to retire the 2021 bond early, Mr. Chae said. Blackstone offered a coupon of 2.50% for the 10-year bond it sold alongside a 30-year-bond on Tuesday, compared with 5.875% for the 10-year bond in 2010. \u201cIt is our strategy to put ourselves into the position to opportunistically take advantage of these windows in the market,\u201d Mr. Chae said. The company not only reduced its average cost of debt, but also lengthened the maturity profile of its debt, Mr. Chae said. United Airlines Holdings Inc. sold $1.2 billion of secured bonds to finance the purchase of new aircraft. \u201c[Tuesday] was really the first opportunity for us and other issuers to be in what I would describe as a robust market,\u201d United\u2019s chief financial officer, Gerry Laderman, said, referring to the end of the August vacation season. The airline managed to lower its coupon from over 4.0% to 2.85% compared with a debt sale earlier this year, he said. A surge in demand for investment-grade corporate debt in recent months is helping to drive yields lower, said Gibson Smith, founder of Denver-based Smith Capital Investors. \u201cThe flows are presenting issuers with an opportunity to borrow at new lows,\u201d he said. Mutual funds focusing on corporate investment-grade bonds took in $32 billion over the past three months compared with $77 billion of outflows from all stock funds over the same period, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper. The asset class is still attracting inflows because it occupies a sweet spot in the fixed-income landscape. Some investors worried about slowing economic growth and geopolitical risks are switching out of stocks and high-yield debt into investment-grade bonds. \u201cWe always do a go-or-no-go call on the day and took advantage of the turmoil in equity markets on Tuesday,\u201d said Robert Frenzel, the finance chief of Xcel Energy Inc., which on Tuesday issued $600 million bonds due in 2050 at a yield of 2.99%. Xcel is in the midst of a $4.5 billion expansion program to grow its fleet of wind farms and expects to be back next year to issue more bonds. Mr. Frenzel said. \u201cWe are always looking for an attractive market,\u201d he said. Conversely, government-bond investors that need to make up for the declining yields in their core investments are increasing exposure to corporate debt with high credit ratings. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more flows into credit-oriented products as an alternative to core bond funds that would be more invested in Treasurys and mortgage-backed bonds,\u201d said Andrew O\u2019Brien, a bond portfolio manager at Lord Abbett. Despite some recent signs of weakness, the U.S. economy is still in good shape and that makes the incremental yield pickup in corporate bonds a good play, he said.",

        "content": "The Apple Card has arrived. Sleek white with a titanium base and laser-etched with your name and the Apple AAPL 0.85% logo (but not your card number), it might just be more precious than anything you actually purchase with it. You\u2019ll have to take care of it, though. Published this week, Apple\u2019s care guidelines for its newest piece of metal are intimidating at best. While the card itself should be stored in a wallet, pocket or bag made of soft materials, fabrics like leather and denim are apparently to be avoided as they could leave a stain. Needless to say, most wallets and bags are made of leather, and quite a few pockets are made of denim. The card itself also shouldn\u2019t touch another credit card (lest you scratch it). Other items to avoid are loose change, keys or other potentially abrasive objects\u2014basically everything a woman has in her purse. Cleaning the card is its own beast. The card should be \u201cgently wiped with a soft, slightly damp, lint-free microfiber cloth,\u201d Apple says, moistened specifically with isopropyl alcohol. Perhaps the most confusing part is that you don\u2019t actually need it. Apple says more than 70% of all U.S. retail locations now support Apple Pay. For that, all you need is your tricked out iPhone.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A group of states is preparing to move forward with a joint antitrust investigation of big technology companies, according to people familiar with the situation, adding another layer of scrutiny to an industry already under a federal spotlight. The effort involving state attorneys general is expected to be formally launched as soon as next month, the people said. It is likely to focus on whether a handful of dominant technology platforms use their marketplace powers to stifle competition. As part of the probe, the states are likely to issue civil investigative demands, similar to subpoenas, to tech companies and other businesses, the people said. The new investigation could dovetail with plans by the Justice Department, which last month announced its own antitrust review that will focus on tech companies including Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google unit and Facebook Inc., the people familiar with the plans said. Do you support the decision from the attorneys general to investigate big tech in tandem with the Justice Department? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. The specific number of states that might join the investigation couldn\u2019t be learned, though one person familiar with the effort said up to 20 or more may participate. Google, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., four companies likely to be a focus of the new investigation, all declined to comment. The companies generally say they operate fairly and don\u2019t engage in anticompetitive behavior. The Wall Street Journal reported in June that a number of attorneys general were considering a probe into big tech companies. As that effort moved toward a formal investigation, representatives of about a dozen state attorneys general, including Republicans and Democrats, met with top Justice Department officials in Washington in July to discuss concerns about lack of competition in the tech industry, according to people familiar with the meeting. The political makeup of the multistate group isn\u2019t set. A bipartisan probe could give the investigation broader leverage and help insulate GOP officials from questions over whether their actions are motivated by political concerns, such as how online platforms treat conservative speech. \u201cThe attorneys general involved have concerns over the control of personal data by large tech companies and will hold them accountable for anticompetitive practices that endanger privacy and consumer data,\u201d said a spokesman for New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat. A spokeswoman for North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, said he is \u201cparticipating in bipartisan conversations about this issue.\u201d Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, also a Democrat, said in a statement he continues \u201cto be concerned with the aggregation of data in the hands of a few and [I] am always watchful of any monopoly.\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, put out a statement after last month\u2019s meeting saying that he and other attorneys general discussed \u201cthe real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the internet.\u201d The expected state investigation would add a third major layer of scrutiny for the tech sector. In addition to the Justice Department probe, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating antitrust concerns at Facebook, including the company\u2019s acquisition of nascent tech companies, as well as competitive issues elsewhere in the tech industry. The involvement of state attorneys general could add to complexity and cost for the companies. These officials were a driving force in the landmark joint state-federal antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Microsoft agreed to an array of conditions, including making the Windows platform more accessible to third-party software developers. But the states eventually splintered over whether to accept a settlement. Some experts say their involvement expanded and extended the legal battle, at times significantly. The Justice Department and the FTC earlier this year reached detailed arrangements for reviewing not only Google and Facebook, but also Amazon.com and Apple. It is possible that some of these big-four tech giants could receive scrutiny from multiple antitrust agencies. Asked for comment, a Google spokeswoman referred to congressional testimony last month by Adam Cohen, its director of economic policy, who said the internet search and advertising giant has \u201chelped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world.\u201d At the same hearing, Facebook\u2019s director of public policy, Matt Perault, said the social-media king \u201cfaces intense competition for all of the products and services that we provide.\u201d Representatives of Apple and Amazon echoed those comments at the hearing, each saying their businesses compete against well-established rivals. Regulators, lawmakers and legal experts, however, worry that significant slices of the high-tech marketplace have become uncompetitive. Those include advertising, search, social media, app sales and certain retail sectors, among others. The recent meeting between state attorneys general and the Justice Department was attended by Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the department\u2019s antitrust division, people familiar with the matter said. State and federal officials made a general commitment to work together and may formally join forces, the people said. Joint concerns include tech firms\u2019 data-fueled growth and the resulting difficulty would-be rivals face in entering their markets. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.",

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: The Nasdaq Composite Dropped 3.5% on Monday \u2014and U.S. stocks had their worst day this year. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average saw significant losses but tech stocks fell the most. That\u2019s because investors are worried about the possibility of new tariffs on electronics imported from China. The new tariff on Chinese goods that President Trump announced last week is expected to affect the price of consumer products like Apple\u2019s (AAPL) iPhone. The tariff will go into effect on September 1, unless the two countries reach a trade deal. Until this latest threat, tariffs had mainly affected commodities, like steel and aluminum. China\u2019s government has weakened its currency to the lowest level in more than a decade. The move was seen as a retaliation in its trade war with the U.S.\u2014cheaper currencies make exports more competitive in global markets. It was a surprisingly strong response from China. The government also\u2014reportedly\u2014told its state-owned businesses to stop buying U.S. agricultural products. Bitcoin tends to climb when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. That\u2019s because rate cuts lead to currency depreciation. And Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which means it can be used to store value, though its price is volatile. There was a rate cut last week\u2014and the market sees a rising chance of a September rate cut because the U.S. trade war with China has escalated quickly. Here\u2019s another possible reason for Bitcoin\u2019s rally: Cryptocurrency helps citizens avoid government controls on their money, analysts say. So, if the trade war is making some Chinese investors uneasy, they could be using Bitcoin to move money out of the country. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is our daily podcast. Find out more here.

        "content": "Everything from umbrellas to iPhones may soon be casualties of the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion of goods from China, effective Sept. 1. And we could finally start to see the impact in consumer prices, according to Wells Fargo. \u201cOur bet is that consumer price inflation will rise slightly,\u201d Wells senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note Monday. \u201cAlthough that will not derail consumer spending, the latest round of tariffs could weigh on confidence.\u201d Consumers haven\u2019t felt much impact from earlier rounds of the trade war because the tariffs mostly targeted goods in the production pipeline, such as steel and aluminum, Quinlan writes. Manufacturers largely absorbed cost increases, limiting the impact on prices. But the new round of tariffs would impact broad categories of finished goods like toys, clothing, and consumer electronics. Yes, iPhone prices may go up more than usual this September with some analysts estimating that Apple (ticker: AAPL) will raise prices by up to $100 due to the tariffs. The company wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on June 17, urging him to give Apple\u2019s products a waiver. Proposed tariffs would cover all of Apple\u2019s majors products and accessories, the company wrote, and would \u201cweigh on Apple\u2019s global competitiveness. However, President Trump has tweeted that Apple will not be given a tariff waiver. More prosaically, it may be costlier to buy one of those cheap umbrellas sold by street vendors the moment it starts raining. Umbrellas top the list of categories that would be exposed to new tariffs. Umbrellas from China account for 93% of imported umbrellas, making them almost certain to rise in price. Toys are next on the list, with 81% of imported toys coming from China, followed by textiles, footwear, books, and musical instruments. According to Quinlan, $28 billion of U.S. apparel, $27 billion of toys, and $14 billion of footwear imports came from China last year. This new round of tariffs has \u201cthe capacity to more meaningfully impact U.S. inflation and consumer spending than earlier rounds did.\u201d A spike in inflation isn\u2019t certain, though. Importers may have some flexibility to push back on costs, Quinlan notes, and suppliers in China could absorb costs. Another factor is currency; China already appears to be retaliating against the new tariff threat by allowing its currency to weaken, making its goods cheaper to buy in China and sell abroad. Quinlan estimates that the latest round of tariffs will add only 0.1 percentage point to the year-over-year rate of the consumer-price index. That\u2019s partly because suppliers and importers may absorb cost increases. But about 75% of the CPI is composed of services that are largely insulated from tariffs, he writes. Goods account for the remaining 25% with clothing at 2.3% of the total, footwear 0.7%, and toys at 0.2%. It\u2019s harder to gauge the knock-on effects: The impact on consumer sentiment and on the broader economic relationship between the U.S. and China. The perception that prices are rising may keep consumers from opening their wallets, restraining spending (the engine of the U.S. economy). The other impact, of course, is on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is watching for signs of the trade war\u2019s broader impact on capital investment and economic growth. If the Fed detects more of a tariff-induced slowdown, we may see several more rate cuts. Unfortunately, that won\u2019t contain lasting damage from fraying trade relations between the two largest economies on the planet. And it may be like opening an umbrella as a hurricane approaches.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump moved Thursday to extend tariffs to essentially all Chinese imports, escalating a trade conflict that is poised to hit U.S. consumers in the pocketbook and roiling financial markets. The new tariffs would take effect Sept. 1 and cover $300 billion in Chinese goods\u2014including smartphones, apparel, toys and other consumer products. They would come on top of tariffs already imposed on $250 billion in imports from China. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to trade with us anymore, that would be fine with me,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House. According to a person familiar with the situation, the tariff hike was opposed by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow and national security adviser John Bolton. But Mr. Trump was adamant in pushing the increase and was supported by White House adviser Peter Navarro, this person said. Jeff Emerson, spokesman for Mr. Lighthizer, said he \u201csupports the president\u2019s action.\u201d Wall Street was rattled by the news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average erasing a rebound of more than 300 points. The index closed down 281 points, or 1.1% lower. The S&P 500 slid 0.9% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8%. Oil prices sank almost 8%, their biggest drop since February 2015. The U.S. action could prompt fresh retaliatory measures from Beijing, although there is also the possibility Mr. Trump could withdraw his threat before the new levies go into force. Mr. Trump made public his plans to impose tariffs in a series of tweets that followed a briefing from his trade team on this week\u2019s negotiations in Shanghai. Those talks ended with neither side detailing significant progress toward resolving the more-than-yearlong dispute. Mr. Trump said that senior officials still planned to resume high-level discussions as scheduled next month, and he expressed his interest in reaching \u201ca comprehensive Trade Deal\u201d with China. But Mr. Trump chided President Xi Jinping of China for not following through on what the Trump administration views as prior commitments. \u201cChina agreed to\u2026buy agricultural products from the U.S. in large quantities, but did not do so,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cAdditionally, my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of Fentanyl to the United States\u2014this never happened, and many Americans continue to die.\u201d How effective do you think the new U.S. tariffs on China will be? Join the conversation below. An official at the Chinese Embassy in Washington didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the slow progress in trade talks was partly the result of a new tactic from Beijing, which increasingly thinks waiting may produce a more favorable agreement. In the U.S., business groups condemned the escalation of tariffs. \u201cTariffs are not the answer, escalation is not the answer,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. \u201cWe have to be careful about actions undertaken by either government that would stir the pot and not create the best atmosphere for getting these complicated talks back on track.\u201d The tariffs, essentially a tax paid by importers in the U.S., affect practically all the groups of Chinese products not hit previously, with the exception of select categories, such as medicines. Unlike previous rounds of tariffs, which have focused largely on industrial goods, the $300 billion tranche is set to include a host of consumer products, from electronics and cellphones to apparel. The tariffs would affect about $45 billion in cellphones, $39 billion in laptops and tablets, and $5.4 billion in videogame consoles, according to the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group. The tariff plans threaten to undermine U.S. sales of iPhones and other Apple products, which are largely produced in China. Apple would either have to eat the tariff costs on iPhones\u2014which analysts have estimated would be about $40 on the import price of XS models\u2014or pass those costs on to customers. Apple\u2019s business in China also faces risks from potential Chinese retaliation, trade experts and analysts said. The company, which has relied on China, Hong Kong and Taiwan for about a fifth of sales, would be a potential target for China because it had a nearly 6% share of the Chinese smartphone market in the June quarter. Shares of Apple fell 2.1% Thursday, erasing a 2% surge on Wednesday after the company reported it returned to sales growth in the three-month period ended June 29. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. The toy industry, which sources about 85% of products from China, has been bracing for the tariffs, including moving manufacturing to places like Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico and importing the goods into the U.S. sooner. Hasbro Inc. has notified retailers that it plans to raise prices on any toys hit by tariffs and it also expects that retailers will take ownership of inventory in the U.S. instead of China, which will add to the toy maker\u2019s shipping and warehousing costs, according to Chief Financial Officer Deborah Thomas. Like Hasbro, Mattel, which makes Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, is looking to reduce its manufacturing footprint in China. \u201cWe have put together a contingency plan and are working closer with retailers to make sure we mitigate the impact,\u201d Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said in an interview last month. \u201cThere are different levers we can pull,\u201d he said, including using manufacturers and vendors in other countries. Toy makers may struggle to raise prices during the holiday season because they have already set prices with retailers, said Steve Pasierb, president of the Toy Association trade group, meaning that the tariffs will hit the manufacturers\u2019 profits. A larger concern is that as prices rise for other consumer goods hit by tariffs, consumers may think twice about spending as much on discretionary purchases like toys. \u201cIt\u2019s a big concern because holiday spending power is important as we finish the year,\u201d Mr. Pasierb said. North Carolina entrepreneur Brett Portaro, who has developed a line of Powercharger Corp.-brand cellphone-charging accessories, said he was disappointed by the tariff news. \u201cFor a new company like Powercharger, we can\u2019t adjust our supply chain fast enough since almost all of the lithium-ion batteries used in our products are made in China,\u201d he said. The tariffs plan is the latest move by Mr. Trump to put pressure on the Chinese side in hopes of winning concessions to help U.S. businesses and farmers. Previous warnings of additional tariffs have often been postponed, but three rounds eventually took effect. Economists say the trade conflict is souring investment and hurting economic growth in both countries. Many Republican and Democratic lawmakers have backed Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of confronting Beijing as a necessary step to achieve structural changes in the Chinese economy. \u201cTariffs aren\u2019t the only solution President Trump should use to pressure China, but China isn\u2019t making any friends in Congress with its behavior,\u201d wrote Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in a tweet. \u201cChina has a responsibility to follow through on its commitments on fentanyl + ag purchases + trade talks.\u201d About three-quarters of Republican voters support tariffs on China without approval from the World Trade Organization, while about three-quarters of Democrats oppose them, according to a June survey from the University of Maryland. One Democratic presidential candidate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, said in the primary debate on Wednesday that she would remove the tariffs if elected. The latest round of tariffs, if imposed, is likely to generate more complaints from consumers and voters. On the other hand, Mr. Trump also faces potential criticism going into a presidential election year if he compromises deeply and cuts a deal with China, since Democrats and hawks in his own party have signaled they would criticize any perceived shortcomings. The Trump administration appears to be aiming to alleviate consumer and business concerns by starting with tariffs of only 10%, a move that also allows U.S. officials room to raise the tariff level in the future if China doesn\u2019t follow through with concessions. \u201cThe 10% is for a short-term period and then I could always do much more or less, depending on what happens with respect to a deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Meanwhile, U.S. farmers are increasingly suffering from retaliation from China and other countries where the Trump administration has penalized trade. Farm products are also facing a disadvantage in Japan, which has opened its markets to other countries through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal from which Mr. Trump withdrew. After meeting Mr. Xi in Osaka, Japan, in June, Mr. Trump and administration officials said they had won commitments from Beijing to purchase more U.S. agricultural products. The administration is also seeking a quick trade agreement with Japan focused on agriculture. But Beijing hasn\u2019t said that it committed to the purchases, and Chinese firms have made only limited purchases of agricultural commodities in recent weeks. The U.S. team in Shanghai this week, led by Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Mnuchin, was hoping the Chinese side would commit to purchasing a defined quantity of U.S. agricultural goods, people following the talks said. China is likely holding out on buying large amounts of U.S. farm goods while waiting for concessions from the U.S. side, the people said. Mr. Trump has said his administration would take a softer approach on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co., allowing firms to do business with the blacklisted company if it doesn\u2019t trigger security concerns. So far the Trump administration hasn\u2019t formalized licenses for U.S. firms to sell semiconductor chips and other products to Huawei. Administration officials are looking at a plan that would allow chip companies to sell to Huawei consumer products, such as cellphones, but not sell advanced chips to the company\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure, which many U.S. officials view as a national-security threat. \u2014Katy Stech Ferek and Andrew Restuccia in Washington, Tripp Mickle in San Francisco and Paul Ziobro in New York contributed to this article.",

AAPL 0.85% \u2019s AirPods met with no small amount of derision when they first hit the market three years ago, with reviewers and critics competing to conjure the most colorful comparison for the wireless buds.

He also believes Apple is now close to selling about 10 million AirPod units per quarter. By way of comparison, it took the iconic iPod five years to reach that sort of scale. And it didn\u2019t look like a Q-Tip.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% hasn\u2019t quite been able to rejoin the world\u2019s most exclusive club of companies. The tech giant\u2019s shares were up 4.3% at about midday Wednesday after a better-than-expected earnings report. That seemed to put it on track to be worth more than $1 trillion again, based on a count of shares outstanding that the company released in May. But Apple\u2019s rally lost steam amid a marketwide swoon, and its shares closed at $213.04, up 2%. Then after markets closed, Apple reported that its number of shares outstanding had shrunk by about 82 million over the past quarter. That put its market capitalization at $963 billion\u2014well short of $1 trillion. To surpass the $1 trillion mark, Apple would need to close at $221.28 a share or higher. Currently, only Microsoft Corp. has a market cap north of $1 trillion. It has been nearly nine months since Apple last flirted with such a valuation. The iPhone maker first closed above $1 trillion on Aug. 2, 2018, and stayed above that level through Nov. 1, 2018, according to FactSet. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has struggled this year with soft iPhone sales and trade tensions with China. But Apple\u2019s latest quarterly results, released late Tuesday afternoon, showed that revenue rose 1% to $53.81 billion for the three months ended June 29, an improvement from back-to-back revenue declines in the previous quarters. The company offset a decline in iPhone sales with revenue growth in every other area of its business, including iPad and Mac. Following the earnings report, Citigroup raised its price target for Apple to $250 a share from $205, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch boosted its target to $240 from $230. E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. has traded above a $1 trillion market cap on an intraday basis, but never closed above $1 trillion.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% countered another quarter of weak iPhone sales with strong revenue growth from its supporting businesses, the latest in a series of positive results from Silicon Valley\u2019s tech titans. Revenue rose 1% to $53.81 billion for the three months ended June 29, Apple said Tuesday, an improvement from back-to-back revenue declines in the previous quarters. Profit slid for the third straight quarter, dropping 13% to $10.04 billion, though per-share earnings of $2.18 exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. Apple offset a 12% decline in iPhone sales during the period with revenue growth in every other area of its business, including iPad and Mac. Sales from services\u2014a closely watched business that includes App Store sales, mobile payments and device insurance\u2014rose 13% to $11.46 billion in the period, the smallest quarterly increase since 2015. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to report a return to growth,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on an earnings call. The iPhone business, which posted sales of $25.99 billion, continued to weigh on results as customers hold on to smartphones longer and competition increases from rivals in China offering lower-price, feature-rich handsets. It was the first time since 2013 iPhones didn\u2019t account for the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue in a quarter, according to eMarketer. Apple said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $61 billion and $64 billion, above consensus expectations. It returned $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion in share repurchases. Shares of Apple rose more than 4% in after-hours trading to $217.45. Before the report, the stock fell 0.4% Tuesday to $208.78. China\u2019s economic doldrums also hurt Apple, which counts on the country for about a fifth of its revenue. Sales in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, sank 4% to $9.16 billion. The decline was a marked improvement from the prior two quarters, when revenue in China fell more than 20%. Apple has reduced iPhone prices in China to be more competitive with lower-price handsets from rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. , but its share of the country\u2019s smartphone market fell 0.6 percentage point to 5.8% during the June quarter, according to Canalys, a market research firm. Huawei has been gaining share from rivals in China, including Apple, by touting itself as the patriotic choice to Chinese consumers willing to weigh politics as they make a smartphone purchase, Canalys said. The Trump administration in May attacked Huawei, blocking sales of U.S. technology to the Chinese smartphone giant. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if but when Apple gets hit in China,\u201d said Richard Kramer, an analyst who tracks the company for Arete Research. \u201cThey have a material brand and reputation issue to face, thanks to the Trump administration and Huawei.\u201d Huawei said on Tuesday that revenue rose sharply in the first half of the year despite its blacklisting issues with the U.S. Tuesday\u2019s report followed a string of strong results from tech giants, which continue to deliver huge profits amid intensifying regulatory scrutiny. Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. last week delivered revenue growth of about 20% or more behind sustained dominance of their core businesses: social media, digital advertising and e-commerce. The tech titans\u2019 supremacy has put them in the crosshairs of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The Justice Department is opening a broad antitrust review into whether the companies unlawfully stifle competition, and the European Union in March penalized Alphabet\u2019s Google for limiting how websites displayed ads sold by its rivals. What do you think of Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings report? Join the conversation below. Apple has largely avoided being drawn into the fray. It fielded fewer questions earlier this month than its peers during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the power of online platforms. Still, it faces lawsuits from customers and developers in the U.S. over its control of the App Store, which serves as the only software distribution system for the more than 900 million iPhones world-wide. And Spotify Technology SA filed an antitrust complaint in Europe, alleging Apple has made it difficult for rival subscription services to market themselves in the App Store, which the company denies. The legal challenges could undermine Apple\u2019s growing services business, which counts on the App Store for about a third of sales. \u201cHistory has shown these things tend to take a long time to play out, but we have to be aware that risk is out there,\u201d said Trip Miller, founder of Gullane Capital Partners, a Memphis, Tenn.-based firm that counts Apple among its largest holdings. Apple is mired in one of the weakest years of Mr. Cook\u2019s tenure. In April, it reported its first back-to-back decline in quarterly revenue and profit in more than two years. That followed the slashing of its quarterly revenue forecast in January for the first time in more than 15 years, a move prompted by the sharp downturn in iPhone sales and struggles in China. The company\u2019s business challenges have come amid turnover in its executive ranks. Last month, it said its chief design officer, Jony Ive, was departing to form his own independent design company. His departure came less than three months after retail chief Angela Ahrendts left the company. Apple also has lost several members of its close-knit industrial design team and some key engineers earlier this year. Mr. Cook has charted a new path forward, shifting the company\u2019s focus from a business defined by hardware hits to one that aims to sell software and services. It plans to release new subscription services for original TV shows and videogames this fall, as well as a credit card in August. Analysts say Apple\u2019s plan for three iPhones\u2014two with triple rear cameras and one with a double-rear camera\u2014lacks the sizzling features that compel customers to upgrade, especially at prices of $1,000 or more. It isn\u2019t expected to deliver features that drive upgrades until 2020, when analysts expect Apple to release its first iPhones with 5G chips. Apple faced criticism last week from President Trump, who said his administration wouldn\u2019t provide waivers from tariffs for parts of its Mac Pro computers. Mr. Cook told analysts Apple is seeking those exclusions because it wants to make its new Mac Pro in the U.S. It recently began manufacturing that high-end, desktop computer in China after making its previous Mac Pro model in Austin, Texas. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making the Mac Pro in the U.S. We want to continue doing that,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe\u2019re working and investing currently in capacity to do so because we want to continue to be here.\u201d Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com",

We\u2019re heading into the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. So far, more companies on average have been beating expectations. Industrial results have been soft, but strong consumer spending has helped businesses exposed to main street. Apple (AAPL) and Mastercard (MA) report on Tuesday. So do a number of drugmakers including Pfizer, Merck, and Eli Lilly. On Wednesday, General Electric, Qualcomm, and Kraft Heinz are the highlights. They\u2019re followed by Verizon Communications and General Motors on Thursday. Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron close out the week\u2014both report on Friday. \u2014from its May IPO price. The alternative-meat producer reports second quarter earnings this evening. The last time Beyond Meat (BYND) reported quarterly results in early June, its stock nearly doubled. Management gave a 2019 sales forecast that was about 2% higher than Wall Street was expecting. That small adjustment was enough to trigger a buying stampede. Beyond Meat has quickly become the market\u2019s latest cult stock, with an eye-popping valuation based more on hope than fundamentals. It\u2019s latest market value? A hefty $12.2 billion. \u2014this week. It\u2019s implied from futures pricing for the Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate. The conventional logic says that lower interest rates result in higher stock prices. That\u2019s because a rate cut reduces borrowing costs and that spurs investment and economic activity. It also reduces discount rates when calculating valuations. And stocks have rallied in recent weeks on the promise of lower rates. If the market\u2019s forecast doesn\u2019t match what the Fed decides, a fair amount of those gains could be reversed. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is our daily podcast. Find out more here.",

        "content": "\ufeff AAPL 0.85% Apple isn\u2019t known for granting favors, but the iPhone maker did Intel a solid by taking the modem-chip business off its hands. That still leaves the chip-making giant with plenty of work to do, though this wasn\u2019t fully evident in its strong second-quarter report late Thursday. Revenue for the quarter came in nearly $1 billion above the company\u2019s forecast, mostly from a surprising uptick in PC sales. Intel\u2019s vital data-center business also surprised pleasantly, even though sales there were down 10% year over year as cloud-service operators cooled capital spending relative to a big jump last year. But only a portion of the quarter\u2019s upside flowed through to Intel\u2019s full-year forecast. Citing China trade uncertainty, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan said he was \u201ca little more cautious\u201d about the second half of the year than he was three months ago. Intel is also still scrambling in its costly effort to ramp up its latest 10-nanometer production technology. Arch-rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is already in full production on the advanced process. So selling the unit to Apple is a smart move. It removes a money-losing business that was unlikely to stick around for the long term anyway given Apple\u2019s desire to design its own processors. It also frees up resources for more significant challenges. Intel says it expects as much as $500 million in cost savings this year from the sale, but it also maintained its operating-margin target for the full year at 32%. It can ill afford more delays. The company initially planned to launch chips produced on its 10-nanometer process in 2017. PC versions of those chips are expected to ship in volume later this year. But Intel said Thursday that 10-nanometer chips for servers will now see a \u201cvolume ramp\u201d in the second half of 2020\u2014later than previously implied. Wall Street took note. Matthew Ramsay of Cowen said the move will give rival AMD a full year on the market with its 7-nanometer Rome server chips produced by TSMC. Intel went into its report as the weakest stock in semiconductors, with its share price up only 11% for the year. But the stock still slipped a bit Friday morning, as investors realized the chip maker still has formidable challenges ahead. Getting $1 billion out of Apple may turn out to be the easy part.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Justice Department is opening a broad antitrust review into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition, adding a new Washington threat for companies such as Facebook Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. The review is geared toward examining the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services, the department said, confirming the review shortly after The Wall Street Journal reported it. The new antitrust inquiry under Attorney General William Barr could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms. The review is designed to go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector that were crafted by the department and the Federal Trade Commission. The two agencies, which share antitrust enforcement authority, in recent months worked out which one of them would take the lead on exploring different issues involving the big four tech giants. Those turf agreements caused a stir in the tech industry and rattled investors. Now, the new Justice Department review could amplify the risk, because some of those companies could face antitrust claims from both the Justice Department and the FTC. The FTC in February created its own task force to monitor competition in the tech sector; that team\u2019s work is ongoing. The Justice Department will examine issues including how the most dominant tech firms have grown in size and might\u2014and expanded their reach into additional businesses. The Justice Department also is interested in how Big Tech has leveraged the powers that come with having very large networks of users, the department said. There is no defined end-goal yet for the Big Tech review other than to understand whether there are antitrust problems that need addressing, but a range of options are on the table, the officials said. The inquiry could eventually lead to more focused investigations of specific company conduct, they said. The review also presents risks for the companies beyond whether antitrust issues are identified. The department won\u2019t ignore other company practices that may raise concerns about compliance with other laws, officials said. \u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\u201d Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said in a statement. \u201cThe department\u2019s antitrust review will explore these important issues.\u201d Representatives for Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment. In after-hours trading Tuesday, shares for those four companies were down. Apple was down by about 0.4%, Amazon by about 1.13%, Alphabet by about 0.96%, and Facebook by about 1.65%. The Big Tech companies have said they are highly innovative firms that create jobs and provide products and services that consumers love. They have said they have rightly won their places atop the tech pyramid and have to compete fiercely to stay there. The Justice Department already has been preparing to probe whether Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google is engaging in unlawful monopolization practices. The Journal earlier reported the department\u2019s plans for that investigation, whose existence hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the agency. The department\u2019s antitrust division will conduct both reviews; it is unknown if and when the two efforts will intersect. On the broader tech review, the division will work in close coordination with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the officials said. What do you think the Justice Department\u2019s new antitrust inquiry should focus on? Join the conversation below. The department appears to be hitting the ground running. It recently hosted a private presentation where officials heard from critics of Facebook, including academics, who walked through their concerns about the social-media giant and advocated for its breakup, according to people familiar with that meeting. Tech and antitrust observers believed issues related to Facebook\u2019s dominance were to be handled by the FTC. Both the FTC and the Justice Department have made clear that they view tech-sector competition issues as a priority. Under agreements brokered in recent months between Mr. Delrahim and FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, the Justice Department obtained clearance to proceed with a probe of whether Google has engaged in illegal monopolization tactics, as well as jurisdiction over Apple for similar issues. The FTC, meanwhile, won for itself the right to explore monopolization questions involving Facebook and Amazon. (The commission already has undertaken a lengthy consumer-protection investigation of Facebook\u2019s privacy practices, and the company has agreed to a $5 billion fine.) Justice Department officials said those agreements weren\u2019t meant to be open-ended or all-encompassing. But in any case the department isn\u2019t trying to pre-empt the FTC\u2019s work, they said, and suggested the two agencies might explore different tech practices by the same company, as well as different legal theories for possible cases. The two agencies have been in regular contact at both the leadership and staff levels to coordinate their efforts, according to a person familiar with the discussions. While the top tech firms were once the darlings of the public, attitudes have shifted as some consumers, and politicians on both the left and the right, have grown uncomfortable with how much power and influence they wield in the economy and society. Some Democratic presidential candidates have called for the breakup of companies like Google and Facebook, while lawmakers of both parties have sounded alarm bells, though at times for different reasons. Some Republicans have voiced concerns about whether tech companies disfavor conservative voices, claims that industry leaders have denied. President Trump has escalated his criticisms of Big Tech recently, openly suggesting the U.S. ought to sue Google and Facebook, comments that could hang over the Justice Department\u2019s new efforts. Aside from Justice Department and FTC scrutiny, a House antitrust subcommittee also is taking a broad look at potential anticompetitive conduct in the tech sector. Executives from Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon all testified before the panel last week. Seeds for the new Justice Department review were planted in January at Mr. Barr\u2019s confirmation hearing, when he said that he believed antitrust issues in the tech sector were important. \u201cI don\u2019t think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,\u201d Mr. Barr told senators. \u201cYou can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.\u201d Justice Department officials said they would use the new antitrust review to seek extensive input and information from industry participants, and eventually from the dominant tech firms themselves. It isn\u2019t yet known whether much of the information-gathering will be done on a voluntary basis or if companies eventually could be compelled by the government to turn over materials. \u2014Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s mobile apps routinely appear first in search results ahead of competitors in its App Store, a powerful advantage that skirts some of the company\u2019s rules on such rankings, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The company\u2019s apps ranked first in more than 60% of basic searches, such as for \u201cmaps,\u201d the analysis showed. Apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales, like Music or Books, showed up first in 95% of searches related to those apps. This dominance gives the company an upper hand in a marketplace that generates $50 billion in annual spending. Services revenue linked to the performance of apps is at the center of Apple\u2019s strategy to diversify its profits as iPhone sales wane. While many of Apple\u2019s products are undoubtedly popular, they are held to a different standard by the App Store. Apple tells developers that downloads, user reviews and ratings are factors that influence search results. Yet more than two dozen of Apple\u2019s apps come preinstalled on iPhones and are shielded from reviews and ratings. Apple says it doesn\u2019t give its own products an advantage over others on the App Store. The company conducted its own tests this month in response to the Journal\u2019s questions and some searches yielded different results in which their apps didn\u2019t rank first, a spokesman said. The company uses an algorithm that relies on machine learning and past consumer preferences, and the app rankings fluctuate. Apple doesn\u2019t disclose details on how it works.

Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google were penalized by regulators for that reason. \u201cWhen you become big and pervasive, the promotion of self-interest runs afoul of antitrust laws,\u201d said David Yoffie, a business professor at Harvard University and co-author of the book \u201cThe Business of Platforms.\u201d Complaints from rival businesses about self-promotion are helping fuel a backlash against technology giants. The companies are seeking to allay fears in Washington and Europe that tech giants have too quickly concentrated economic power to the detriment of smaller businesses. On July 16, Apple and three other tech heavyweights were questioned by House Judiciary Committee members during a hearing about the power of online platforms. Politicians from both parties demanded more regulatory scrutiny. A day later, European Union regulators announced an antitrust probe into Amazon.com Inc. that will examine whether the e-commerce giant is abusing its dual role as a seller of its own products and a marketplace operator. Legal challenges are mounting over the App Store. The U.S. Supreme Court in May ruled against Apple\u2019s attempt to halt a lawsuit claiming consumers are forced to buy apps exclusively from the company. Two app developers are also suing in federal court, alleging the App Store amounts to a monopoly on distribution. The company previously declined to comment on the lawsuit. Spotify Technology SA in March filed an antitrust complaint in Europe against Apple, alleging Apple has made it difficult for rival subscription services to market themselves in the App Store, which the company denies. Apple says it uses 42 factors to determine where apps rank in search but keeps the formula secret to maintain a level playing field for developers and prevent the manipulation of results. The four factors that most influence the rankings are downloads, ratings, relevance and \u201cuser behavior,\u201d according to the company. User behavior, which Apple says is the most important factor, includes the number of times users select an app after a query and also download it, a spokesman said. Rankings from search results in Apple\u2019s store can make or break an app. The company says searches lead to 65% of all app downloads. There are more than 900 million iPhones world-wide. Number of Apple's apps that ranked first: In all three searches 11 In two searches 16 In one search 8 Zero times 4 Note: The study's more than 600 searches were conducted in June. Searches excluded Apple apps that weren't discoverable in the App Store such as Safari, as well as apps specific to Apple products such as Apple Support. Source: WSJ analysis of Apple's App Store Audiobooks.com, an RBmedia company, largely held the No. 1 ranking in \u201caudiobooks\u201d searches in the App Store for nearly two years. Then last September it was unseated by Apple Books. The Apple app had only recently begun marketing audiobooks directly for the first time. \u201cIt was literally overnight,\u201d said Ian Small, Audiobooks.com\u2019s general manager. He said the change triggered a 25% decline in Audiobooks.com\u2019s daily app downloads. The app at the time had 35,000 customer reviews and a 4.8 on the App Store\u2019s 5-star ranking. The preinstalled Apple Books app, with no reviews or ratings, has since ranked No. 1 in searches for \u201caudiobooks.\u201d It also ranks first in searches for \u201cbooks\u201d and \u201creader.\u201d Apple says the No. 1 position for Books in a \u201cbooks\u201d search is reasonable, since it is an exact name match. The app was also first for \u201caudiobooks\u201d because of \u201cuser behavior data\u201d and the inclusion of \u201caudiobooks\u201d as a keyword associated with the app, a spokesman said. Apple\u2019s role as both the creator of the App Store\u2019s search engine and the beneficiary of its results has rankled developers. They contend Apple is essentially pinning its apps No. 1, compelling anyone seeking alternatives to consider Apple apps first. Such a tactic would help preserve loyalty to Apple\u2019s mobile operating system\u2014a key to future iPhone sales\u2014and encourage the use of revenue-generating apps such as Apple TV and News, developers say. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple News.) \u201cIt\u2019s definitely unfair,\u201d said Sam Liang, CEO and co-founder of Otter.ai, which developed an app that competes with Apple\u2019s Voice Memos. \u201cPeople always look at the first one, thinking that\u2019s the best one.\u201d An Apple spokesman said its search algorithm works the same for all apps, including its own. Tech giants have amassed millions of loyal users who are potential customers for ancillary businesses. Google has used its leadership in search to sell its Nest thermostats in its online store, and Amazon has capitalized on its e-commerce dominance to market a host of products under its own AmazonBasics brand, such as batteries. The WSJ conducted more than 600 searches over two days in mid-June to review where Apple\u2019s apps rank in the App Store. The Journal used at least three keyword searches related to about 40 Apple apps and other apps from competitors. The analysis relied on terms from AppTweak, which suggests keywords to help developers optimize their search results. In the map category, WSJ tested \u2018maps,\u2019 \u2018directions,\u2019 and \u2018navigation.\u2019 Apple apps that aren\u2019t discoverable in the App Store were excluded, such as Camera and Safari. Some apps tied to company operations, such as Apple Support and Apple Events, were also excluded. The searches took place on six iPhone models in the U.S. using the latest iOS 12.3.1. operating system. Three were personalized and three were unattached to a specific owner. The Journal found minimal variability between phones, except for a few minor differences, such as for apps linked to Apple Watch. On the iPhone, the App Store typically displays two apps after each search: A paid advertisement followed by the most relevant app to the query. A recent search for \u201cmusic\u201d offered an Apple Music ad followed by the Apple Music app. To see more, users have to scroll down. Apple\u2019s apps that generate sales for the company appear more often at No. 1 than its productivity and utility apps, the Journal found in its tests conducted in June. For example, searches for keywords in categories related to the Apple TV app\u2014\u201cvideos,\u201d \u201cTV\u201d and \u201cmovies\u201d\u2014were led by both Apple TV and the iTunes Store, apps that offer subscriptions and sales of video content. Competitors such as Amazon Prime Video, with more than one million reviews and near-perfect ratings, ranked just inside the top 10 for \u201cmovies.\u201d Netflix Inc.\u2019s iPhone app has an average ranking of 22 over the past year in searches for \u201cmovies,\u201d according to App Annie, an analytics firm focused on apps. Many common searches yielded multiple Apple apps above competitors. A search for \u201cmaps\u201d offered Apple\u2019s Maps first, followed by two other Apple apps: Find My iPhone and Indoor Survey. The more widely used Google Maps came up fourth with more than two million reviews and a 4.7 rating. It was followed by Google\u2019s Waze, which had more than 1 million reviews and a 4.8 rating. Apple\u2019s Maps also came up first in searches for \u201cnavigation\u201d and \u201cdirections.\u201d Indoor Survey, used by businesses to map an indoor space, was the only Apple app of the three with a rating\u2014seven reviews for a 3.9 rating. A company spokesman said Apple often surfaces apps associated with one developer in bundles. Because this appeared to be disfavoring others, Apple said it is no longer applying this technique to its own apps. The company began phasing out this practice a year ago, a spokesman said. The Journal conducted at least three basic keyword searches in almost 40 categories to determine which apps show up first. The tests were conducted with six iPhone models using Apple\u2019s latest operating system and showed minimal variabilities in rankings. Apple\u2019s apps didn\u2019t always show up No. 1 in searches. For example, in a search for \u201cspreadsheet,\u201d Google Sheets came up first, while Apple\u2019s competitor, Numbers, appeared eighth. Its preinstalled Reminders app didn\u2019t show up in the top 10 for searches for \u201cto do list\u201d or \u201cto do.\u201d How should tech companies handle their own products on platforms they control? Join the discussion below. In publicly available online guides for developers, Apple emphasizes that \u201cratings and reviews influence how your app ranks in search results.\u201d One guide titled \u201cOptimizing for App Store Search\u201d on Apple\u2019s website states the company is \u201cconstantly evolving\u201d how search works in the App Store. Yet Apple doesn\u2019t include reviews and ratings for the apps that are automatically downloaded with its operating system. It recently began allowing users to delete some of those preinstalled apps. To give users a chance to recover apps they may have deleted, the company added them to the App Store. A spokesman said preinstalled apps don\u2019t need to be rated because they\u2019re already integrated into the iPhone. Some apps, such as Books, previously were not built into the mobile operating system. After that changed, Apple removed ratings for those apps, a spokesman said. In a few cases, Apple apps were previously rated poorly. Apple Books previously enabled reviews and had a 2.7-star rating before Apple eliminated the reviews, according to Sensor Tower, an app-industry research and marketing firm. Another Apple app, Podcasts, previously averaged a 1.7-star rating before reviews were eliminated, according to Sensor Tower. It appears No. 1 in a search for \u201cpodcasts.\u201d Phillip Shoemaker, who led the App Store review process until 2016, said Apple executives were aware of Podcasts\u2019 poor ratings. Around 2015, his team proposed to senior executives that it purge all apps rated lower than two stars to ensure overall quality. \u201cThat would kill our Podcasts app,\u201d an Apple executive said, according to Mr. Shoemaker, who has advised some independent apps on the App Store review process since leaving Apple. The proposal was eventually rejected, Mr. Shoemaker said. An Apple spokesman said Apple executives don\u2019t recall Mr. Shoemaker\u2019s comments. Apple says most searches in the App Store are for exact app titles and that it is built to produce those results. But some searches for the app titles of competitors served up Apple\u2019s apps first. A search for \u201cthe podcast app\u201d in the Journal\u2019s tests surfaced Apple\u2019s Podcasts, Find My Friends and Apple Books rather than a popular alternative called The Podcast App. That app appeared at No. 4 with over 88,000 reviews and a 4.8 rating. Apple says its search for \u201cthe podcast app\u201d ranked its own Podcasts No. 1 due to \u201cuser behavior data\u201d in the U.S. In the U.K., The Podcast App ranks No. 1, a spokesman said. Apple has long argued that it doesn\u2019t have a monopoly in apps or other products. It has a 14% share of the global smartphone market and a 35% share of the U.S. market, according to Strategy Analytics. Its App Store controls 100% of the apps downloaded on more than 900 million iPhones around the world and 100 million iPhones in the U.S. That makes it different from Google\u2019s Android, the other major mobile operating system, which allows people to download apps without going through its store. Apple\u2019s 30% cut of most digital sales on the App Store last year generated an estimated $14 billion in revenue for the company. It added more than $1 billion in digital-advertising revenue from ads it sells against search terms in the store, according to people familiar with the business. The search ad business began in 2016. The only way for competitors to be visible above Apple apps in some searches is to pay for the advertising space that precedes the top result in the rankings. Nearly a year and a half after launching the voice-recording app Otter, Mr. Liang\u2019s service to capture and share conversations has earned more than 2,000 5-star reviews and been named Apple\u2019s App of the Day but hasn\u2019t cracked the top 50 in searches for \u201cvoice recorder,\u201d according to App Annie. Otter has paid Apple tens of thousands of dollars to advertise its app on searches for \u201cvoice memos\u201d and \u201cvoice recorder,\u201d said Mr. Liang. The marketing expense helps the transcription app surface before Apple\u2019s Voice Memos but also means the company has less money to hire artificial-intelligence experts to improve the product. \u201cI hope at the end of the day the best product wins because of accuracy, because of innovation,\u201d Mr. Liang said. \u201cWe want to invest more on that aspect, however, instead of hiring another two AI Ph.D.s, we have to use that money to just get ranked higher.\u201d \u2014Abigail Summerville contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Who\u2019s going to benefit when the streaming TV bubble pops? Maybe one answer is to be found here: In March the tiny Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment bought a controlling stake in Crackle, the free, ad-supported streaming service that Sony nurtured with millions of dollars without ever quite finding the sweet spot. When a company buys another company it\u2019s exchanging one asset (cash) for an asset presumably of comparable value. Yet Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment\u2019s stock popped 36% on the news. We all know what\u2019s going to happen soon. Deep-pocketed players like Disney, Apple and AT&T\u2019s Warner Media are getting ready to join the subscription streaming wars, taking aim at Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Showtime, CBS All-Access and others. Billions will be spent producing more TV than Americans can watch or will be willing to pay for. The big players are clawing back content from each other, including Netflix\u2019s two most watched shows \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cFriends,\u201d which will soon appear exclusively on rival services. For consumers this can mean only one thing: Soon they\u2019ll have to subscribe to six or eight streaming services and pay for a lot of drecky content they don\u2019t watch to get the stuff they do. All this has Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment CEO Bill Rouhana metaphorically rubbing his hands. \u201cThe streaming war is going to be amazing,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how much money is going to be destroyed.\u201d Crackle\u2019s new proprietor actually wants to throw Netflix, Disney and the rest a life preserver: Recoup some of your investment by letting the same content appear on an ad-supported streaming service. Economists call this price discrimination, and they don\u2019t mean something bad by it. They mean making the same product available in slightly different forms to suit a different customer\u2019s willingness to pay, in a way that doesn\u2019t undermine demand for the high-priced version. Mr. Rouhana\u2019s small-fry status meant he barely got his foot in the door when Sony announced plans to sell Crackle last year. He prevailed with a unique offer. He invited Sony to remain as a partner and thereby not look like an idiot if ad-supported streaming took off in a few years and became a multibillion-dollar business. The premise is hardly implausible: While millions of viewers have shifted to streaming, only a small portion of the $70 billion in annual TV ad spending has followed them so far. Mr. Rouhana\u2019s name may ring a bell. He presided over the collapse of Winstar Communications during the telecom bubble of the 1990s. Like any good bubble, it left a great deal of underutilized infrastructure in its wake, and Verizon ended up owning much of what Winstar built. This time, Mr. Rouhana hopes to be the one picking up the pieces of others\u2019 strategic gambles. Chicken Soup for the Soul, in case you\u2019re wondering, produces the best-selling self-help books. Mr. Rouhana bought the company because he had an intuition that brands were important amid the internet cacophony. (Chicken Soup is a brand that says \u201cnice,\u201d he points out.) Then, thanks to a squabble among the principals, he got a good deal on a global video-rights distributor, which incidentally owned Popcornflix, a free, ad-supported movie site whose app has been downloaded 24 million times. Next came his Crackle coup, and now he\u2019s a budding entertainment mogul. He and I are chatting because of a line in a column a few weeks ago in which I pooh-poohed Apple\u2019s announcement of yet another subscription service and suggested that the \u201creal entrepreneurial challenge today is creating ad-supported streaming that really works for viewers and advertisers.\u201d Everybody understands why digitally targeted advertising is superior to the traditional broadcast kind, but how to optimize it for a streaming audience? Hulu is trying \u201cpause\u201d ads that roll the moment you stop your program. Countdown ads let you know how long till your show resumes. Mr. Rouhana likes ads embedded in programs whose budget is covered by an advertiser from day one. What\u2019s known as FAST\u2014free, ad-supported streaming\u2014is still in its primitive accumulation phase, he says. His viewers mainly find him by googling \u201cfree movies,\u201d but he hopes to keep them coming back with a mix of home-grown content, the occasional first-run movie, and maybe someday an ad-filled re-airing of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d We\u2019ll see. The stock has been down lately but a shakeout is obviously coming. Finding what to watch has increasingly become a time-consuming chore. Wading through Netflix is unrewarding. Nobody\u2019s recommendation engine seems to be worth a damn. For all the talk of binge watching, the epidemic now is of shows and movies abandoned halfway through.",

        "content": "In two decades at Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% Jeff Williams has gone from heading procurement to leading all of the tech giant\u2019s operations. Now he has a new responsibility: creating the iconic gadgets that make Apple hum. That will be a critical test for both him and the company, which is in need of a new hit. Apple\u2019s chief operating officer since 2015, Mr. Williams has long been seen as a possible future CEO. Last week\u2019s announcement that he will take over management of software and hardware design when chief design officer Jony Ive leaves this year\u2014the company\u2019s biggest executive change in years\u2014fueled anticipation that Mr. Williams is the heir apparent to Tim Cook. Meanwhile, Mr. Williams\u2019s ability to identify the right projects and reject the wrong ones, and to push software and industrial designers forward, will go a long way to determining Apple\u2019s success. Design has been central to Apple\u2019s formula since Steve Jobs, with help from Mr. Ive, revived the company in the 1990s. Putting Mr. Williams in charge marks a departure for Apple: Never before has core product creation been directly managed by someone who ascended through the operating ranks\u2014a staid domain of planning, procurement and logistics. Apple didn\u2019t make Mr. Williams available for this article, but people who have worked with him say he has been more visible in the product-development process than Mr. Cook. Mr. Williams has shown interest in products\u2019 look and feel, they said, and helped steer the Apple Watch from being a fashion- and fitness-focused product tethered to the iPhone to one that boasts wireless connectivity and more health features, one of his priorities. Still, Mr. Williams is an operations executive at his core, the people said, and his skills at logistics and planning make him more implementer than inventor. \u201cHe sees where we are, not where we need to be in years to come,\u201d said a former colleague, who also praised Mr. Williams\u2019s leadership, versatility and encyclopedic memory. Apple has sought to emphasize Mr. Williams\u2019s involvement in product development, which encompasses research and development, as well as the business strategy behind bringing new products to life. His biography on Apple\u2019s website was recently changed to read: \u201cJeff led the development of Apple Watch in close collaboration with the design team, and oversees the engineering teams responsible for Apple Watch.\u201d Until late last month, that section read: \u201cHe also oversees the development of Apple Watch,\u201d according to an archived version of the page. Apple declined to comment on the change. Some close Apple watchers say Mr. Williams\u2019s new responsibility makes sense given the difficulty anyone outside the company\u2019s executive team would face replacing Mr. Ive. His role entailed leading a team that helped conceptualize products and turn those ideas into elegant, functional physical forms, collaborating with software, hardware and operations divisions, said people familiar with the process. \u201cIt would be almost impossible to find someone who can really replace Jony Ive,\u201d said Bob O\u2019Donnell, a technology analyst with TECHnalysis. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is saying, \u2018let\u2019s reallocate how we think about this and put someone else overseeing a few young designers to give them leeway.\u2019 It\u2019s time for fresh blood. The last few iPhones have looked really similar.\u201d Indeed, pressure is growing on Apple to find new product successes. Sales of the iPhone are sputtering, and strength in newer items including the watch and the AirPods wireless earbuds hasn\u2019t made up the difference. In the latest quarter, sales in Apple\u2019s wearables, home and accessories division\u2014which also includes Apple TV and iPod and Beats products\u2014totaled $5.1 billion. However, the total decline in iPhone revenue from a year earlier was $6.5 billion. Apple Music and other services are growing quickly, but the company needs sustained hardware sales to keep the audience for that business growing. \u201cPhones have plateaued, so what\u2019s the next vision?\u201d said Sean Stannard-Stockton, president of Ensemble Capital of Burlingame, Calif., which sold its position in Apple in late 2018 after a decade as a top holding. \u201cYou could have looked at Jony and said: \u2018He\u2019s the soul of Steve Jobs.\u2019 I just wonder about their ability to invent the future now.\u201d Mr. Williams will have a pair of deputies to help him with that effort, not to mention years steeped in the product culture that Mr. Jobs created. Apple last week named Mr. Ive\u2019s former top lieutenant, Evans Hankey, as vice president of its legendary industrial design studio. Ms. Hankey, a product-design graduate from Stanford University, joined the industrial design team about 12 years ago and has managed the design studio for several years. She has shared in a host of product design patents over the years. How important do you think product design expertise will be for Apple\u2019s future success? Join the conversation below. Mr. Williams, who is 56 years old, also will oversee a team of software designers led by vice president of human interface design Alan Dye. A graphic designer who joined Apple\u2019s marketing and communications team in 2006, Mr. Dye has largely led that team for more than five years. An Apple spokesman declined to make Ms. Hankey and Mr. Dye available. Mr. Williams, who received his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at North Carolina State University, shares much with Mr. Cook. Both earned M.B.A.s at Duke University, and both previously worked at International Business Machines Corp. \u2014a onetime Apple nemesis. Mr. Cook preceded Mr. Williams as Apple\u2019s chief operating officer before his selection as Mr. Jobs\u2019s successor as CEO in 2011. Mr. Williams\u2019s involvement in product development has grown over more than a decade. After Tony Fadell, co-creator of the iPod, left Apple in 2008, Mr. Jobs put Mr. Williams on a leadership team with Mr. Ive responsible for developing the iPhone 4, said a member of the team. Some engineers and designers questioned how a supply-chain executive from IBM could replace Mr. Fadell, this person said, but Mr. Williams quieted doubters. The iPhone 4 featured a glass back instead of the plastic used on past models. During a thermal-engineering meeting, Mr. Williams probed the engineers with questions about how new materials would affect device performance, this person said. He also picked up the prototype to evaluate how it felt. \u201cIt was impressive for a negotiator, and spreadsheet guy, and it just came naturally to him,\u201d this person said. Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, said Mr. Williams\u2019s operations background could be an asset in his new role. \u201cYou need to have a balance between what is possible and what makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cIf everyone came at it from a design perspective, that may not lead to the best possible product.\u201d",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is manufacturing its new Mac Pro computer in China, according to people familiar with its plans, shifting abroad production of what had been its only major device assembled in the U.S. as trade tensions escalate between the Trump administration and Beijing. The tech giant has tapped Taiwanese contractor Quanta Computer Inc. to manufacture the $6,000 desktop computer and is ramping up production at a factory near Shanghai, the people said. Apple can save on shipping costs for components given the proximity of many of its suppliers to Shanghai, rather than having to supply a factory in the U.S. While the Mac Pro isn\u2019t one of Apple\u2019s higher-volume products, the decision on where to make it carries outsize significance. Apple\u2019s reliance on factories in China to manufacture its products has been an issue for the company, especially under President Trump, who has pressured Apple and other companies to make more in the U.S. Where does it make the most sense for Apple to assemble its products? Join the conversation below. With the previous Mac Pro model, released in 2013, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook trumpeted plans to build it in the U.S. Apple invested $100 million in tooling and other equipment for a plant in Austin, Texas, run by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd. Each computer was stamped \u201cAssembled in the USA.\u201d Flex and Quanta declined to comment. An Apple spokesman said the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in the U.S. and includes U.S.-made components. Apple said it supports manufacturing in 30 U.S. states and spent $60 billion last year with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers. \u201cFinal assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process,\u201d the spokesman said, adding that the company\u2019s investments support two million American jobs. The Mac Pro is Apple\u2019s most powerful computer, used primarily by a relatively small number of professionals working in industries such as film and videogames. President Trump has pressured Apple to make some iPhones, Macs or iPads in the U.S. since the 2016 presidential campaign. He told The Wall Street Journal in 2017 that Mr. Cook promised to build \u201cthree big plants, beautiful plants\u201d in the U.S., a claim Apple declined to comment on at the time. Last year, as his administration imposed tariffs on imports from China, Mr. Trump said the only way to ensure prices for Apple goods don\u2019t increase would be to make products in the U.S. Apple in the past two years has announced a second campus in Austin to handle customer support and operations, and reported more than $500 million in new contracts with U.S. component suppliers that manufacture at home. But Apple hasn\u2019t disclosed any plans to build new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Making the new Mac Pro in China isn\u2019t likely to affect many workers in Texas because demand for the old model fizzled years ago. The Flex workforce had shifted to refurbishing already-made computers, former Flex employees said. The Flex plant continues to make products for HP Inc. and other companies, they said. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, looking to revive trade talks, are scheduled to meet for lunch Saturday at the Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan. Last year, the Trump administration spared product categories including Apple\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds from an initial round of duties. But the administration\u2019s proposal to impose additional tariffs of 25% covering $300 billion in imports from China would affect all of Apple\u2019s major devices, including the Mac, iPhone and iPad. While it shifts Mac Pro production to China, Apple more broadly is considering moving some of its assembly work out of China because of concerns about U.S. tariffs, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. One of the people familiar with Apple\u2019s plans said that same consideration could extend to the Mac Pro, with Ireland as an alternate possible site. The Mac Pro\u2019s history reflects the hurdles to doing assembly in the U.S. The previous Mac Pro model\u2014known as the \u201ctrash can\u201d because of its stumpy, cylindrical appearance\u2014was the first computer Apple had made in the U.S. in about a decade. Mr. Cook, who had engineered Apple\u2019s outsourcing to China, announced plans to build the product in the U.S. in late 2012, when Apple was facing major scrutiny over its reliance on manufacturers in China and those contractors\u2019 treatment of workers. Flex secured a designation as a Texas Enterprise Zone project at the time of the initiative, entitling it to $250,000 in annual tax breaks in support of $15 million in equipment purchases and 500 jobs with an average annual wage of $30,276, according to the state. The designation expires this month. Almost immediately, Apple ran into challenges at the Flex plant in Austin, former Apple employees said. More than 80% of the workers across three assembly lines were contract employees paid minimum wage for eight-hour workdays, Alan Hanrahan, a former Apple manufacturing supervisor, said in an interview with the Journal two years ago. As soon as their shift ended, many headed out, he said\u2014even if the lines were still running. Then production would stop, only to resume when the next shift was in place, he said. As demand for the Mac Pro tapered off, Flex began laying people off, several former Flex employees said. By last year, they were down to a skeleton crew working just a quarter of one of the assembly lines and refurbishing Mac Pros, said Jeff Gruger, a former vice president of product at Flex. \u201cThey learned it\u2019s very difficult to manufacture in America,\u201d Mr. Hanrahan said of Apple in the 2017 interview. Apple this year overhauled the Mac Pro to give it more power and a radically different silver, rectangular design. The design could be one of the last developed under the leadership of design chief Jony Ive, who Apple announced Thursday will leave the company later this year. Manufacturing labor costs in China, though rising, still remain much lower than in the U.S., said Paul Gagnon, a consumer-electronics analyst with IHS Markit. Quanta has made MacBooks and Apple\u2019s smartwatch for years. In addition to four facilities in China, the Taiwan-based contractor it has a small facility in Fremont, Calif., where it works on custom desktops, according to one of the people familiar with its plans.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said design chief Jony Ive will leave the company later this year to form his own independent design company, marking the end of an era at the iPhone maker as it shifts from an emphasis on product development to services. The announcement is sure to raise new questions about the company\u2019s ability to develop and launch new products. It comes as sales have largely plateaued for the iPhone\u2014which Mr. Ive helped design and which fueled Apple\u2019s surging sales and profit for most of a decade. Apple is seeking new avenues for growth, largely from the sale of app software, entertainment content, financial tools and other services. In April, it reported its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit in more than two years, after saying in January that those two measures had fallen in the holiday quarter for the first time ever. Mr. Ive\u2019s planned new company will count Apple among its primary clients, and he will continue to work closely on projects with Apple, the company said. It said the design team Mr. Ive now manages will be headed by two vice presidents who will report to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams \u2014effectively demoting the team. Mr. Ive, whose title is chief design officer, reports directly to Mr. Cook. \u201cAfter so many years working closely together, I\u2019m happy that our relationship continues to evolve and I look forward to working with Jony long into the future,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a statement. Apple shares, which have been rising in recent weeks but remain well below their record, fell around 1% in after-hours trading Thursday following the announcement. A close acolyte of Mr. Jobs, Mr. Ive was critical to Apple\u2019s revival from near bankruptcy in the 1990s, working alongside the Apple co-founder to design a string of product hits, including the iPod, iPhone and iPad, that transformed Apple into one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. But, despite his prominence in Apple\u2019s management, Mr. Ive has been less engaged in the day-to-day business at the company since he helped spearhead the launch of the Apple Watch in 2015, people close to the designer said. Mr. Ive\u2019s departure seemed inevitable as the company transitioned to being focused on selling services from its history of selling devices, said one of the people close to the designer. \u201cIt\u2019s not a product and design company any more,\u201d this person said. Mr. Ive, in Apple\u2019s announcement, said the design team today \u201cis stronger, more vibrant and more talented than at any point in Apple\u2019s history.\u201d Mr. Cook, whose expertise is in operations, seldom visited the design studio, and Mr. Williams, also an operations expert, cut his product teeth by working on the smartwatch that the company launched in 2015. Mr. Ive\u2019s frequent absence in recent years coincided with questions from analysts and former employees about Apple\u2019s ability to innovate. While sales of the watch have grown in recent years, Apple hasn\u2019t had another massive hardware hit since the iPad in 2010. Mr. Ive\u2019s reduced presence also has contributed to a series of recent departures from the close-knit team, which had four of its designers leave over the past year. After the watch\u2019s launch, Mr. Ive spent about two years working on Apple\u2019s new headquarters, which was billed as an homage to Mr. Jobs, who died in 2011. Mr. Ive returned to lead the design team in late 2017. He continued to split time between the U.S. and U.K. during that period, partly because his father has been ill, people close to the designer said. Mr. Ive and his wife want to spend more time in the U.K., where he and his wife want to raise their children, people close to the designer said. The departure will end a golden era of design at Apple. Under Mr. Ive, the design team reigned supreme at the company, calling the shots on how products looked and what functions they performed. Mr. Ive assumed leadership of the design team in 1996, before which Apple worked with outside design firms to develop new products. He built a team of about two dozen close-knit designers who worked together to develop the tech giant\u2019s simple aesthetic and spearheaded the development of products including the iPhone. The announcement raises additional questions about the future of the design team. Apple said Evans Hankey would serve as vice president of industrial design. Her role over the past year as an operations chief for the industrial design group had contributed to some recent departures, people close to the designer said. Apple also named Sabih Khan senior vice president of operations, elevating the longtime lieutenant of Messrs. Cook and Williams into a higher role as the company deals with a host of supply-chain challenges stemming from proposed tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods that would affect all of Apple\u2019s major products. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com",

        "content": "BERLIN\u2014A senior Facebook Inc. FB 0.69% executive took a veiled shot at Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% continuing the sniping between the tech giants as their business models are under increasing scrutiny from global regulators. In a speech Monday at the Hertie School of Governance in the German capital, Facebook vice president of global affairs and communications Nick Clegg criticized other large tech companies for selling expensive hardware and catering to what he called an \u201cexclusive club\u201d of wealthy consumers. Mr. Clegg, the former U.K. deputy prime minister, argued that criticisms about tailored advertising on the social network fail to underscore that the product remains free for users, unlike products offered by Silicon Valley rivals. \u201cSome other big tech companies make their money by selling expensive hardware or subscription services, or in some cases both, to consumers in developed, wealthier economies,\u201d Mr. Clegg said. \u201cThey are an exclusive club, available only to aspirant consumers with the means to buy high-value hardware and services.\u201d By contrast, he said, \u201cFacebook was founded on a simple principle: We want to connect the world. And you don\u2019t do that by charging for admission.\u201d Mr. Clegg didn\u2019t mention Apple or other hardware companies by name. A spokesman for Facebook declined to offer further context for Mr. Clegg\u2019s remarks. The comments come about a week after Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook gave a speech that was viewed as critical of Facebook. \u201cIt feels a bit crazy that anyone should have to say this. But if you\u2019ve built a chaos factory, you can\u2019t dodge responsibility for the chaos. Taking responsibility means having the courage to think things through,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a commencement address at Stanford University. He said privacy should be a fundamental concern of the tech industry, implicitly drawing a distinction between ad-supported business models like Facebook\u2019s versus Apple\u2019s, which is dependent on hardware sales and subscription services. \u201cIf we accept as normal and unavoidable that everything in our lives can be aggregated, sold, or even leaked in the event of a hack, then we lose so much more than data. We lose the freedom to be human,\u201d Mr. Cook said. The sparring between the two companies comes as regulators are stepping up calls to protect consumers\u2019 data privacy from large tech companies including Facebook, which have built their businesses upon a model of offering free services to consumers and collecting reams of user data to sell to advertisers. In the U.S., the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have taken steps in recent weeks that suggest increased oversight of anticompetitive practices by large tech companies. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google has faced repeated fines by the European Union for its business practices, and in February, German regulators ordered Facebook to stop collecting information about users from third-party sites without users\u2019 consent. Hardware-focused tech giants have sought to position themselves as privacy crusaders, with Apple recently launching a $54 million ad campaign to tout the security of iPhones. In his speech on Monday, Facebook\u2019s Mr. Clegg began his remarks by saying that the company welcomes regulation, acknowledging that the \u201ceuphoria stage\u201d of enjoying Silicon Valley innovations has now given way to an era of suspicion about tech, and along with it higher scrutiny. \u201cThe internet does need competition and it does need regulation. That\u2019s why we want to work with governments and policy makers to design the sort of smart regulation that fosters competition, encourages innovation and protects consumers,\u201d he said.",

Few considered how these services were being paid for. Then a wave of data breaches spurred a new realization\u2014the price of all this great tech was our privacy. Investigative reporting, congressional hearings, and now, government-forced breakups dominate the conversation around technology. This week on The Readback, Alex Eule is joined by Eric Savitz, Barron\u2019s new associate editor covering technology from Palo Alto, California, who has been covering the recent issues facing tech. The Readback is a financial podcast published every Wednesday. Hosted by managing editor of disruption Alex Eule and produced by Mette L\u00fctzh\u00f8ft.",

U.S. production of liquefied natural gas is booming and its export capacities have increased. That combination has caused a global glut. Although demand has increased as more countries, particularly in Asia, have been switching from other fossil fuels to natural gas\u2014it hasn\u2019t kept up with the growing supply. Natural gas\u2019 price drop could spread to coal as power plants switch away from the fossil fuel, which will reduce demand. And as both fuels\u2019 prices fall, power costs should too. \u2014according to one analyst. That valuation is close to the market cap of competing streaming music service Spotify, (SPOT) which is valued at $25 billion. Apple (AAPL) has been emphasizing its portfolio of service businesses as iPhone unit sales slow. The company plans to deliver more of its earnings growth from non-hardware sales. But those plans could stumble if Apple is ever forced to divest its streaming music service, or reduce app store fees to comply with antitrust-related actions. The jump came after Amazon (AMZN) announced that it was exiting the food-delivery business. The online retail giant is a notorious disruptor, but it failed to make much headway against rivals in this crowded space. The competitive market includes other services like DoorDash and Uber Technologies \u2019 (UBER) Uber Eats. Grubhub (GRUB) investors celebrated the taking out of the market a rival as formidable as Amazon Some also speculated that, rather than building its own service organically, Amazon may now prefer to simply acquire the industry\u2019s eventual winner.

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies are set to come into the crosshairs of a House panel led by Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat with an independent streak. On Tuesday, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel will open an investigation into tech companies and antitrust laws with a look at the impact online platforms have had on journalism. The congressional probe comes as the Justice Department prepares to investigate Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google, while the Federal Trade Commission plans to focus on the dominance of Facebook Inc. In addition, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. also could come under scrutiny by the agencies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at the conduct of these large technology platforms and really try to determine whether the existing antitrust framework is sufficient to support competition in this space,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said in an interview. \u201cThe antitrust statutes were principally written more than 100 years ago for the railroads and oil barons\u2014we have a very different economy today.\u201d Among the questions the subcommittee will examine are whether tech companies\u2019 market dominance has allowed them to exclude rivals, engage in anticompetitive behavior, or favor their own products and services, Mr. Cicilline said. The panel will also consider whether the existing legal framework has allowed tech companies to acquire rivals to essentially create monopolies, he said. Big tech companies have disputed that notion, contending that they operate in dynamic, competitive markets while offering services that consumers want. (The scheduled witnesses for Tuesday\u2019s hearing include David Pitofsky, general counsel and chief compliance officer of News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. News Corp has been a critic of big tech firms\u2019 power in the online advertising industry.) Mr. Cicilline expects to conduct the investigation, prepare a report and issue recommendations within this session of Congress, or the next 18 months. \u201cMost of the Democrats arrive with very strong antitrust bones in their bodies,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), a member of Mr. Cicilline\u2019s antitrust subcommittee. \u201cPeople want to make sure that we don\u2019t end up with monopolies just through governmental passivity.\u201d The hearing marks the start of a bipartisan probe being conducted by the committee at the center of a separate political fight: whether to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. On the same day as the antitrust hearing, the full House is scheduled to vote on a measure setting in motion a legal process to enforce subpoenas to Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn. Mr. Cicilline in May became the highest-ranking Democrat to publicly call for starting an impeachment inquiry, a stance not shared by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and opposed by the Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia. But Messrs. Collins and Cicilline share more common ground when it comes to tech companies and the role they now play in the economy. Mr. Collins said he sees broad public interest in privacy concerns related to how tech companies collect and manage user data. He and Mr. Cicilline have also worked together on legislation to allow local news outlets to negotiate with large online platforms regarding how the news outlets\u2019 content is used. \u201cThere are very legitimate questions on an industry that has grown up in the last 15 to 20 years,\u201d Mr. Collins said. Still, the two lawmakers might diverge on some of the tactics deemed necessary to extract information from tech companies. Mr. Cicilline has said he might issue subpoenas, though he hopes that will be unnecessary. Mr. Collins has said he expects enough participation from the companies to avoid subpoenas. \u201cAny talk of subpoenas is way premature,\u201d Mr. Collins said. Mr. Cicilline said his legislative approach has been shaped in part by his earlier legal career, in particular when he worked as a plaintiffs lawyer suing police departments for allegedly violating the civil rights of individuals. \u201cOne of the things that has always informed my thinking is these power dynamics between big powerful people and ordinary Americans,\u201d said Mr. Cicilline, who also served two terms as the mayor of Providence, R.I. Although he leads the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, which helps set messaging strategy ahead of the 2020 elections, Mr. Cicilline at times operates with a degree of independence unusual among high-ranking Democrats. After the 2016 elections, Mrs. Pelosi recommended a slate of three candidates to lead the DPCC that didn\u2019t include Mr. Cicilline. But when Democrats voted, Mr. Cicilline won one of the three spots running the messaging group. That might have left Mr. Cicilline less indebted to Mrs. Pelosi and more willing to express his own opinions, including his mid-May endorsement of starting an impeachment inquiry. Although he hasn\u2019t backed down from that stance, Mr. Cicilline took a more measured tone in a leadership meeting last week, when he said Democrats should emphasize their legislative agenda and oversight efforts, stressing that the president isn\u2019t above the law. \u201cEverybody should heed your advice, including you,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said, according to a person in the room. Mr. Cicilline said Mrs. Pelosi has always encouraged other Democratic leaders to offer their own opinions and that his position has been shaped in part by watching the White House rebuff the Judiciary Committee\u2019s document and testimony requests. \u201cFor members of the Judiciary Committee, because we live with it every day, it\u2019s not surprising [that] I came to this conclusion more quickly than some members of leadership not on Judiciary,\u201d he said. He and Mrs. Pelosi appear closely in line, however, on the antitrust investigation. Mrs. Pelosi last week tweeted out her support for the antitrust panel\u2019s \u201clong overdue investigation to determine if dominant digital platforms have harmed Americans in the marketplace & the voting booth,\u201d and that for giant tech companies, \u201cthe era of self-regulation is over.\u201d Still, there is some skepticism even among critics of tech companies over how much the House investigation can accomplish, compared to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission inquiries. \u201cI\u2019m glad that they\u2019re asking questions about it,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) said of the House probe. However, he said, \u201conly the law-enforcement agencies can actually do anything with real teeth.\u201d \u2014Brent Kendall contributed to this article. What role should Congress play in scrutinizing the power of big tech companies? Join the conversation below.",

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: The 10-Year Treasury Yield Touched 2.07% on Monday \u2014the lowest level since 2017. That\u2019s because investors are worrying about economic growth and tariffs. The worries aren\u2019t new, they have been fueling a rally and pushing yields down for months. But the Treasury-market rally picked up steam late in the trading session on Monday, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to a new low. When the 10-year yield is below the three-month yield, like it is now, it is considered to be a warning about future recession. The Justice Department is said to be laying the groundwork for an antitrust investigation of Google\u2014according to a Wall Street Journal report. U.S. antitrust regulators are reportedly divvying up tech giants for potential investigations. The whole tech sector has been facing more scrutiny from the public, as the size and power of big platforms become common political talking points. Apple and Facebook shares also fell on news that regulators had claimed jurisdiction for potential antitrust probes. The risk of future regulation also caused Amazon and Twitter shares to fall. \u2014according to JP Morgan. That\u2019s the market\u2019s estimate, too. Just one month ago, the Wall Street consensus was that the Fed would keep rates steady all this year. Last week, market prices showed traders expected two or three rate cuts by the end of 2020. Now they expect two this year. That\u2019s a pretty big change. It appears the culprit is the White House\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports.

        "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif.\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% sought to tout itself as a digital-privacy crusader with an anonymous login system and tools that prevent apps from tracking a user\u2019s location, a push that is designed to further differentiate it from Google and Facebook Inc., which have built their fortunes on tracking user activity and behavior. At a gathering Monday of about 6,000 software developers here, the iPhone maker said its mobile operating system coming this fall, iOS 13, will include an Apple sign-in capability that allows people to log into apps without revealing any personal information. It said users would be able to generate automated and random email addresses provided by Apple rather than provide their own. \u201cIt\u2019s a fast, easy way to sign in without all the tracking,\u201d said Apple software chief Craig Federighi onstage at the company\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. He showed the \u201cSign in with Apple\u201d feature alongside similar offerings from Facebook and Google, which he said could share user information in a way that compromised privacy. Apple has weaponized privacy over the past year, marketing it to combat threats posed by rivals increasingly elbowing into its core iPhone business. Last month, Google released a $400 smartphone that it says offers capabilities similar to those of an iPhone at a fraction of the price, and Facebook is working to develop private messaging, payments and e-commerce that could diminish the value of Apple\u2019s iOS. Apple is also seeking to further separate itself from its peers as the U.S. government ramps up its scrutiny of tech giants\u2019 power. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the government\u2019s antitrust enforcers, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, are splitting up oversight of tech companies including Google and Facebook over competition concerns. Facebook already faces an FTC investigation over privacy issues. Amid the skirmishes over privacy, Apple is transitioning from an iPhone-driven company into one powered by a suite of services, such as streaming-music subscriptions, app-store sales and mobile payments. At its developers conference, Apple turned the spotlight back to its other devices beyond the iPhone, introducing new software and services to deepen the appeal of its iPad, smartwatch and Mac businesses. It also bolstered many of its apps, including improvements to Messages that put it in more direct competition with Facebook\u2019s apps. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has stressed privacy by criticizing Google, Facebook and other companies as cavalier in collecting user information. He has cast Apple as pro-privacy, saying it is in the business of selling devices while its peers are in the business of monetizing their customers by gathering data and selling ads. The company has amplified that message by spending more than $54 million on a TV ad campaign that promotes the privacy offered by iPhones, using the tagline: \u201cIf privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on.\u201d The campaign is about half of Apple\u2019s TV ad spending so far this year, according to the ad-tracking company iSpot.tv. Facebook and Google have pushed back with privacy promises of their own. Facebook this year said it is going to provide encrypted messaging and encourage small-group chats. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai sniped at Apple in a New York Times editorial that \u201cprivacy cannot be a luxury good\u201d available to people who buy expensive devices. Apple said its newest mobile-operating system will give users more options for how they share location data with apps, including an option to only share location information once. It also said it is teaming up with security-camera companies to provide more private video tools for people who use cameras to monitor home security. Though the focus of this event is usually dominated by Apple\u2019s newest iPhone software, the company emphasized improvements to its other gadgets. The iPad is getting its own operating system, iPadOS, with new capabilities that make the tablet more capable of performing like a computer. It will have simple copy-and-paste functions, a desktop mode for its Safari web browser and the ability to plug in a thumb drive. The Mac is retiring the iTunes app, which made its debut 18 years ago, and splitting its functionality across Apple\u2019s Music, TV and Podcast. The iTunes brand will continue to exist on the iPhone, and users will still be able to download songs through an iTunes Store tab, the company said. The Apple Watch is getting its own app store, liberating it further from the iPhone where app downloads were previously managed. It also is adding new health capabilities, including the ability to alert users if the environmental noise around them poses a potential problem for their hearing health. Apple introduced new programming tools for developers that are designed to simplify the process of developing apps for the Mac, watch and iPad. The 2.2 million iPhone apps available in the App Store dwarf the 20,000 Watch apps currently offered. Analysts say that discrepancy limits the utility of the Apple Watch and is part of the reason smartwatch sales have lagged behind the iPhone and iPad. The company also sought to promote its growing services business, showing the first trailer from one of the company\u2019s new TV shows, \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d a show from Ronald D. Moore about the space race. The show will be available when Apple launches its streaming-video subscription service this fall. (Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.) Apple needs strong sales of those devices and its services to help counter the downturn in its iPhone business. The company in April posted its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit as sales of the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of total revenue, fell 16% to $83 billion for the first half of the company\u2019s fiscal year. Although the focus of the conference was on software, Apple introduced a new Mac Pro, its most powerful computer designed for complicated and intense tasks. The computer, which will start at about $6,000, includes a new Intel Xeon processor and system memory of up to 1.5 terabytes. A 32-inch LCD screen with a 6K retina display will cost another $5,000.",

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: President Donald Trump Announced a New 5% Tariff \u2014on Mexican goods imported into the U.S. The tariff is set to start on June 10th and will gradually rise to 25 percent. That\u2019s unless Mexico stops illegal immigration to the U.S. Friday\u2019s surprising move puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve. If the trade war causes economic weakness, the Fed, which sees itself as politically independent, could be forced to cut interest rates to soften the blow of the President\u2019s policies. And that\u2019s exactly what he has been asking for. At least, if you include revenue from the stores of four companies the cannabis retailer is in the process of acquiring. If those deals go through, Curaleaf Holdingswill become the largest cannabis seller in the U.S. But other cannabis companies are also riding the wave of fast growth. Harvest Health & Recreation has deals under way that would bring its quarterly revenue to just over $50 million from $19 million. The flurry of deals is all part of the companies\u2019 strategy of expanding into new states that have legalized marijuana\u2014or are about to. \u2014in the first quarter of 2019. That decline is largely caused by consumers hanging onto their phones longer as Apple\u2019s new models keep getting pricier. That strategic conundrum is what the company will be facing, going into today\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Investors will eagerly await updates on how the company is faring in its efforts to attract subscription revenue. Investors will also want to hear more on how the ongoing trade war with China is impacting the company\u2019s sales and supply chain. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is a new daily podcast.

        "content": "Here\u2019s something you may like, even love, if it doesn\u2019t make you angry or sad. A German company, the Emoji Co. GmbH, claims it owns the word \u201cemoji.\u201d Since 2013 the firm has filed hundreds of applications for \u201cEmoji\u201d as a trademark in every profitable merchandise category in the U.S. trademark registry. When Sony Pictures Animation wanted to make \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d in 2016, its trademark applications were all rejected because the Emoji Co. had beaten it to the punch. As far as trademark law is concerned, the word Emoji is like the word Disney. That\u2019s absurd. Apple released an iOS update adding an \u201cemoji keyboard\u201d to every iPhone in 2011\u2014two years before the Emoji Co.\u2019s first trademark application. Google soon did the same with its Android operating system. Sony could easily have contested the Emoji Co. trademarks on grounds that the term is generic. That\u2019s how the Kellogg Co. was able to market Shredded Wheat. Nabisco had marketed its cereal first, and an appeals court held that it was entitled to the trademark. The Supreme Court disagreed. \u201cTo establish a trade name in the term \u2018shredded wheat,\u2019 \u201d Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co. (1938), Nabisco \u201cmust show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d That\u2019s why companies like Xerox, Kimberly-Clark (maker of Kleenex) and Dow Chemical (Styrofoam) spend big bucks on branding. They don\u2019t want their marks to go the way of trampoline, escalator or rollerblades, all of which began life as trademarks but were eventually declared generic. Imagine if Xerox never registered its name as a trademark, but another company swooped in and did, then made millions exclusively selling T-shirts and mousepads with pictures of Xerox machines\u2014but no actual machines, which would violate Xerox\u2019s patents. That\u2019s what the Emoji Co. is doing. So why didn\u2019t Sony sue? Because the entire point of \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d was to profit off the popularity of emojis. Sony wouldn\u2019t want it advertised that they were in the public domain. Thus it licensed the marks from the Emoji Co. for an undisclosed sum. That has a completely predictable, twofold effect. First, it has a massive chilling effect. It tells filmmakers, artists, clothing designers and other creative types that if they have an idea involving emojis, it\u2019s probably not going to be worth the legal headache. Second, it validates the Emoji Co. in the \u201cbrand licensing industry.\u201d You can read all about it at emoji.com, an unforgettable website that boasts about Sony and its hundreds of other \u201ccorporate partners.\u201d The Emoji Co.\u2019s business model is, in short, to accumulate enough trademark registrations in enough of the most profitable merchandise categories, from which it can then exclude competitors, that they add up to a de facto right of publicity in the concept of emojis, world-wide. There are notable parallels in pharmaceutical patent practice, in which a pharma giant will prevent a drug from going generic when its patent expires by retaining dozens of patents on processes required to produce the drug. But the pharma giants at least invented the drugs. On the other hand, who\u2019s to say we aren\u2019t better off with a rent-seeking brand-licensing shell company controlling the representation of emojis? Maybe the law is working when a trademark owner can permit the making of \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d but not \u201cBlue Emojis,\u201d a hypothetical dark independent satire about screen addiction. We\u2019ll get to see eventually, as the Emoji Co. has big plans. It hopes to compete with Sony one day in film, TV and online entertainment and is getting its feet wet with Emoji Records, whose first single is \u201cWe Don\u2019t Need Words to Talk.\u201d Its recent trademark applications suggest the company also plans a move into online gambling. All this has fascinating implications for trademark and unfair-competition law. But the immediate question is simple: If you wanted to describe the 2015 Oxford Dictionary \u201cword of the year\u201d\u2014the symbol thousands of publications described at the time as \u201cthe crying emoji\u201d\u2014what generic term would you use?",

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: The Average Return for Equity Hedge Funds Was 8% \u2014in the first quarter. It\u2019s significantly short of the S&P 500\u2019s 15% rise over the same period. Hedge fund managers were hesitant to embrace the market rally this year. During the first quarter, funds cut their bets that stocks would rise, indicating a less bullish view. They also moved toward certain sectors in the first quarter, including consumer discretionary, communication services, and health care. And the funds sold stocks in energy, materials, and industrials. \u2014if China decided to ban the sale of Apple products, Goldman Sachs has estimated. Last week, the Commerce Department required U.S. businesses to apply for licenses to do business with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies because of national-security concerns. Thus far the impact has largely fallen on American semiconductor companies, because they had to immediately cut off sales to Huawei. But if China decides to retaliate, Apple could become a target. Many retailers are reporting first-quarter earnings this week, but Target has been the only one to impress investors with its results. Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl\u2019s (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), and Macy\u2019s (M) all saw their stocks tumble in the past week after missing Wall Street estimates \u2013or because they lowered their forecasts for the rest of the year. Target, on the other hand, boasted strong first-quarter numbers and e-commerce growth. The company also struck an optimistic tone about its outlook. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is a new daily podcast.

        "content": "A federal judge\u2019s ruling that Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% unlawfully stifled competition in the market for wireless chips cast a new cloud over the tech giant and set the stage for further upheaval in its dealings with the world\u2019s smartphone makers. The decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who sided with the Federal Trade Commission in its antitrust suit against Qualcomm, delivered a major blow to a company that has been held up by the Trump administration as a keystone in U.S. technological competition with China. The ruling directly targets the patent-licensing business that has been the San Diego-based company\u2019s biggest source of profit. It could lower costs for Apple Inc. and other smartphone makers that have complained Qualcomm\u2019s pricing tactics allowed it to profit off innovations, such as new displays or cameras, unrelated to its patents. Those companies and Qualcomm have been battling over the costs of its technology at a time when the smartphone market has slowed, pressuring their profits. The reversal comes a little more than a month after Qualcomm celebrated one of its largest triumphs: a deal with Apple that ended years of bitter litigation and positioned it to supply critical chips for future iPhones running on next-generation wireless networks. Qualcomm\u2019s shares sank nearly 11% Wednesday on the ruling, shearing off another chunk of the chip maker\u2019s more than 50% run-up in the weeks after the Apple deal. Qualcomm has weathered thorny royalty disputes before. But Judge Koh\u2019s ruling could be far-reaching, undercutting Qualcomm\u2019s business while at the same time affecting U.S. national competitiveness in next-generation wireless technologies. As one of only a handful of companies capable of making cutting-edge versions of phone connectivity chips called modems, Qualcomm could be forced to negotiate less lucrative deals with existing customers and extend its intellectual property at less favorable terms, gutting a business that historically represented most of the company\u2019s value. \u201cIf you were to hold them to the letter of the law and what Koh has put forth, it\u2019s devastating to their [licensing] business,\u201d Susquehanna International Group analyst Christopher Rolland said. The ruling\u2019s practical effect remains to be seen, however, as Qualcomm pursues an appeal. Analysts said the scale of the loss of revenues, should the decision stand, was hard to gauge, given the complexity of Qualcomm\u2019s contracts and uncertainty about how much they would have to be discounted. Despite the FTC ruling, Qualcomm executives believe the settlement terms preserve the agreement with Apple, people familiar with the matter said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. The judge\u2019s ruling clouds the outlook for Qualcomm, which long has generated more profit from patent licensing than the sale of its chips. Judge Koh\u2019s ruling that Qualcomm must license some of its industry-essential patents to rival chip suppliers\u2014something it previously refused to do\u2014means Qualcomm may have to forgo royalties of 5% of the sales price up to $400 on handsets and instead assess fees based on the $15 to $20 cost of modem chips. Bruce Hoffman, who heads the FTC\u2019s bureau of competition, called the decision \u201can important win for competition in a key segment of the economy.\u201d The case was brought by agency Democrats over Republican dissent at the end of the Obama administration. Though GOP appointees now hold a 3-2 majority, Republican Chairman Joseph Simons is recused, a situation that complicated potential settlement talks. In addition to the FTC case, Qualcomm faces a class-action lawsuit from consumers asserting similar antitrust claims and seeking billions in damages. The ruling also has U.S. policy implications. The Trump administration has regarded Qualcomm as vital in competing with China for dominance in 5G technology, which is rolling out in the world\u2019s cellular networks this year. The Justice Department took the unusual step of wading into the FTC-Qualcomm case early this month, asking for a hearing on any penalty against Qualcomm in a bid to limit damage to 5G technology the company is developing. Judge Koh, however, said in her ruling that a hearing on remedies wasn\u2019t necessary. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The FTC case focused on Qualcomm\u2019s policy of selling its chips only to companies that agree to pay licensing fees for a group of cellular-technology patents that Qualcomm owns. Qualcomm is by far the leading supplier of chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The FTC said that dominance gave Qualcomm the leverage to force companies to pay steeper licensing fees than what Qualcomm\u2019s patents are worth. The commission alleged that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing conditions meant that it got paid even when device makers built phones using another company\u2019s chips, a situation that made rival chips less attractive in the marketplace. Qualcomm said that, since its early days, it has licensed its patented cellular technologies for an upfront fee and used the revenue to invest in research and development. The company said it didn\u2019t change its approach once it grew into a leading seller of chips. The cellular market is healthy and competitive, Qualcomm argued, noting that its market share has dropped in recent years. And it said its customers\u2014including Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Co.\u2014were too big and powerful to be pushed around by Qualcomm. The same issues were at the heart of the bitter, two-year legal battle between Qualcomm and Apple that nearly led to their chief executives, Steve Mollenkopf and Tim Cook, taking the stand in their trial. The iPhone maker\u2019s settlement with Qualcomm included a six-year licensing agreement that analysts estimate will pay the chip maker $8 to $9 per device in licensing fees. The FTC decision has the potential to increase demand for modem chips sold by rivals such as MediaTek Inc. Those chips for years were less attractive, analysts said, partly because smartphone makers who bought them also had to pay Qualcomm\u2019s high patent royalties. Intel Corp. , another competitor, last month said it would halt efforts to develop 5G modem chips for smartphones because it couldn\u2019t see a path to profitability. The company has been losing more than $1 billion annually on its modem business, according to a person familiar with the operation. Judge Koh pointed to numerous suppliers who had exited the modem market because Qualcomm made it difficult for them to win supply agreements with smartphone makers. She said rivals that remain in the market have been hobbled by Qualcomm\u2019s practices. How do you think the latest ruling against Qualcomm will force the company to change its business model?

        "content": "TOKYO\u2014 Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% Dell Technologies Inc. DELL 0.74% and two other U.S. technology companies are set to give up their preferred shares in Japanese chip maker Toshiba Memory Holdings Corp. for more than $4 billion under a refinancing plan, according to people familiar with the plan. The U.S. companies, which are customers for Toshiba TOSYY 0.24% Memory\u2019s semiconductors, helped a Bain Capital-led consortium take over the chip maker from former parent Toshiba Corp. in June, preventing Western Digital Corp. WDC 3.72% from taking control of its memory joint venture with Toshiba. A takeover by Western Digital might have further consolidated a market in which Samsung Electronics Co. has already established a dominant presence. A package of \u00a51.3 trillion ($11.8 billion) in financing to be in place soon from Japanese banks would enable Toshiba Memory to buy out the preferred shares from the four American companies, according to the people. A simplified capital structure would also make it easier for Toshiba Memory to list itself, one of the people said. The listing would allow the capital-intensive chip business to access funds from the public-equity market. Apple, Dell, Kingston Technology Co. and Seagate Technology PLC are set to sell their preferred shares back to Toshiba Memory for about \u00a5500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) by the end of May, according to the people familiar with the plan. Together those companies made a few hundred million dollars on their investments, one of the people said. Apple and Kingston declined to comment. Dell and Seagate didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Toshiba Memory aims for a listing in Tokyo near the end of the year or at the beginning of next year, according to one person involved with the planning, with the timing dependent on market conditions for semiconductors and public equities. Some bankers have said the listing would take place this year. A recent slump in chip prices means now wouldn\u2019t be the best timing for a listing, the person said. Under the refinancing plan, three major Japanese banks would lend \u00a51 trillion, and the government-owned Development Bank of Japan Inc. would invest in preferred shares worth \u00a5300 billion, replacing existing bank loans and the preferred shares owned by the four American companies, according to the people familiar with the plan. The refinancing doesn\u2019t change the ratio of voting rights: 49.9% for Bain Capital; 40.2% for Toshiba; and the remaining 9.9% for Japanese optical product maker Hoya Corp.",

The White House has threatened to introduce 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. If that happens, the smartphone maker may have to raise its prices or just accept lower profitability. China is a large part of Apple\u2019s supply chain, and FactSet estimates Apple gets almost 20% of its revenues from there. The Chinese coffee chain had its first day of U.S. trading on Friday. The company, known as the \u201cStarbucks of China,\u201d rallied as much as 47% early in the session. Later, however, it erased some of those gains. The chain plans to open 2500 new stores in China by the end of 2019. If Luckin succeeds, it will beat Starbucks to become the largest coffee chain in China. \u2014through Friday afternoon. It\u2019s always tough to say what makes Bitcoin\u2019s price move. But prices were low for most of this year\u2014until the past month and a half. Bitcoin started rallying right around the time the U.S.\u2019s trade war with China started heating up. Analysts say that investors are selling China\u2019s currency and moving into cryptocurrency and other markets. More trade-war escalation could cause China\u2019s currency to decline against the dollar\u2014and possibly, help Bitcoin climb further. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is a new daily podcast.

        "content": "BEIJING\u2014Escalating volleys of tariffs by the U.S. and China stand to pile pressure on already stressed supply chains, potentially pinching technology companies and consumers on both sides of the Pacific. Proposed tariffs by the U.S., released Monday, would hit finished technology products such as smartphones and smartwatches, as well as videogame consoles and other consumer products. Meanwhile, tariff increases ordered by China of as much as 25% affect some components that go into some of these products, including semiconductor packaging materials and certain types of displays. Both governments are giving themselves room to maneuver in their latest escalation. China\u2019s new punitive levies don\u2019t take effect until June 1. A U.S. decision last week to raise tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese goods won\u2019t start to bite until around that time, given the lag for shipping. And Monday\u2019s proposal by the U.S. to slap levies of as much as 25% on the remainder of imports from China, around $300 billion in products, would take weeks to put in place. Companies and trade experts said that, unlike previous rounds in the year-old trade dispute, the new penalties, if unchecked, are likely to drive up costs for more products that would partly be passed to consumers. \u201cBoth sides are running out of options that will damage the other\u2019s economies without blowing back onto consumers at home,\u201d said Shaun Roache, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region at S&P Global Ratings. He said that until now, the U.S. focused its tariffs on components and other intermediate goods, rather than finished consumer goods. Doing so, he said, raised costs for companies, but at a level producers and importers could bear largely without raising prices for American consumers. Some companies in recent weeks have begun acting on contingency plans in anticipation of escalating tariffs. Sweden-based telecom-gear maker Ericsson AB is preparing to shift some manufacturing out of China to facilities in the U.S., Estonia, Brazil and Mexico, a spokesman said. Made-in-China cellular-tower equipment, routers and switches are on the U.S.\u2019s $200 billion list subject to 25% tariffs. Taiwan-based AsusTek Computer Inc. said last week that it has been moving some production bases to Taiwan and Vietnam from China to limit impact on a U.S. tariff increase on motherboards and graphic cards. \u201cWe already discussed contingency plans with our suppliers,\u201d AsusTek co-CEO Samson Hu said in a quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe impact on us will be minimal, because we adjusted before.\u201d A huge question is what happens to Apple Inc. The company makes most of its products, including iPhones, in China through contract manufacturers. While the proposed U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods includes smartphones, companies may petition that their products be excluded before the levies take effect in late June at the earliest. Apple didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. As of Tuesday, Apple hasn\u2019t communicated major plans to shift production for key products to Foxconn Technology Group, its main assembler, people familiar with the matter said. Foxconn didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Apple suppliers have said that fully moving out of China is difficult: China\u2019s skilled workers and well-developed supply chain are difficult to replicate elsewhere in short order. How long the tariffs would be in place and whether the two sides can strike a trade deal also are holding suppliers back from making significant shifts, they say. In recent months, Foxconn, which assembles a huge share of iPhones, has been considering producing the devices in India, an emerging smartphone market. It is also looking at Vietnam, though it hasn\u2019t said what it plans to make there. Any fallout on Apple\u2019s China production base could be troublesome for Beijing, too. Foxconn is the largest private employer in China, and the Chinese government wants to keep employment steady and prevent the trade fight from undermining a fragile recovery in the economy. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that tariffs won\u2019t solve the dispute and that while Beijing wants a negotiated solution, its resolve shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \u201cChina does not want or wish for a trade war, but it is by no means afraid of one,\u201d ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a weekday briefing. In the wake of the latest tariffs, Chinese media have amped up criticisms that stringent U.S. demands in trade talks ultimately aim to prevent China from moving up the value chain and competing in the global economy. One item on the U.S.\u2019s proposed tariff list is made-in-China lithium-ion batteries. Those batteries are the most expensive component in electric vehicles, a sector China wants to dominate globally and has been subsidizing heavily. A 25% tariff would make it tough for the Chinese imports to compete with batteries offered by Korea\u2019s LG Chem Ltd. and Japan\u2019s Panasonic Inc., which both already have U.S. production facilities. \u2014Stu Woo, Chunying Zhang, Dominique Fong and Trefor Moss contributed to this article.",

The Dow and S&P 500 both fell 2.4%, their biggest declines since January 3 Global stock markets sold off after the trade war between the U.S. and China escalated. The real market stress started on Monday, when China responded to higher U.S. tariffs by raising its own levies on U.S. goods. Even the bond market responded to the trade news. Treasuries rallied, and the yield curve inverted\u2014that\u2019s a recession signal that last showed up back in March. \u2014the company\u2019s second day of public-market trading. The ride-sharing company had its IPO last week, which valued it around $82 billion. Uber raised $8 billion of extra funding in the IPO. The bulk of the cash went to professional investors who owned shares of the company when it was private. That\u2019s good news for those private investors, but bad news for investors in public markets, who have watched the stock drop \u2014after the Supreme Court ruled that a lawsuit from its customers could move forward. The lawsuit centers on the 30% fee that Apple charges developers who sell apps through its store. Consumers say those costs are passed on to iPhone users, and wouldn\u2019t be if they could buy apps elsewhere. Apple argued that consumers should take up their complaint with the app developers, who set the final prices. The company\u2019s services revenue, which includes its app store, matters more for Apple\u2019s growth than it used to, because customers are upgrading their phones less often.

Video-game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and investment manager Legg Mason (LM) report on Monday. Ralph Lauren (RL) and Agilent Technologies (A) are on Tuesday. Wednesday is the busiest day \u2013 Macy\u2019s (M) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) both report, as do Chinese tech giants Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Thursday\u2019s highlights will be Walmart (WMT), Pinterest (PINS), and Nvidia (NVDA). And finally, farm equipment manufacturer Deere (DE) reports on Friday. The industrial metal has declined for four consecutive weeks, and it has underperformed others like nickel and zinc this year. But in the long term, copper looks set to rise for two key reasons. First, new uses such as electric vehicles could boost demand. At the same time, new mine growth has been slow and some analysts project shortages of copper in coming years. Rising demand and stagnant supply is a recipe for prices to increase. The ETF tracks the S&P 500 index and is the most-popular passive fund available. It\u2019s market-cap weighted\u2014meaning companies with the greatest market values like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) make up a proportionately larger part of assets. For a perhaps timely hedge against the dominance of those tech stocks, investors may want to consider a fund that does the exact opposite. The Reverse Cap Weighted U.S. Large Cap ETF (RVRS) is one. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is a new daily podcast. Find out more here. This episode was hosted by Nick Jasinski.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% posted its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit in more than two years, but the tech titan reported strength beyond its struggling iPhone business and said a sharp downturn in China showed signs of easing. Sales of the iPhone, long the biggest driver of its business, fell 17% to about $31 billion\u2014an accelerated decline for a product that has been hobbled by smartphone owners holding on to devices longer and by competition from rivals in China offering lower-price, feature-rich handsets. The company\u2019s results exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations, which had ebbed following a surprising slump in the previous quarter. Chief Executive Tim Cook highlighted glimmers of hope in problem areas including China, where he said customers have reacted positively to Apple\u2019s move to lower iPhone prices and offer financing programs. \u201cLooking back at the past five months, November and December were the most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe like the direction we\u2019re headed with the iPhone, and our goal now is to pick up the pace.\u201d Apple said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion, above consensus expectations. Apple also blunted the damage from its iPhone business by extending the robust growth of services like app sales and streaming-music subscriptions, which collectively jumped 16%. It also said it would add $75 billion to its continuing share-buyback program. Shares of Apple surged about 5% after-hours, after falling in regular trading. Through Tuesday\u2019s close, Apple\u2019s stock was up about 27% this year, recouping most of the losses it racked up in the final two months of last year. Its market value is on course to once again top $1 trillion. Tuesday\u2019s report followed a mixed bag of quarterly results from tech giants, including a major stumble by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet Inc. that caused its stock to plunge nearly 8% on Tuesday, its worst decline in more than six years. Both the digital-advertising giant and e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. over the past week reported their slowest revenue growth in four years as their core businesses showed signs of maturity. Microsoft Corp. , meanwhile, topped $1 trillion in market value at Tuesday\u2019s close for the first time after reporting strong earnings last week. The iPhone\u2019s woes have threatened to define one of the weakest years in Mr. Cook\u2019s tenure. In January, Apple reported its first decline in revenue and profit for the holiday quarter. It last experienced consecutive quarterly declines in 2016 amid weak demand for the iPhone 6s, which offered limited improvements over preceding models\u2014much like this year\u2019s iPhone XS and XR. Mr. Cook has combated the adversity with a new strategy: expanding Apple\u2019s services business and increasing the price of its gadgets. In March, it announced new subscription services for original TV shows, videogames and magazines, as well as a credit card. It raised prices late last year on iPads, helping it increase sales 22% in the latest quarter even as analysts estimate shipments remained flat. Mr. Cook also highlighted success\u2014especially in China\u2014of trade-in programs added to revive iPhone sales. The company is offering customers with older iPhone models above-average prices for those devices if they exchange them for new iPhones, he said. Investors have largely shrugged off the iPhone troubles and focused on Apple\u2019s potential to generate billions of dollars in revenue by selling subscriptions across the more than 900 million iPhones world-wide. They also were encouraged that the company struck a multiyear agreement in April with Qualcomm Inc. for smartphone modem chips that should allow Apple to deliver an iPhone in 2020 with speedier, 5G wireless technology. \u201cThey have reset expectations,\u201d said Mike Bailey, research director at FBB Capital Partners LLC, which has $1.1 billion under management and counts Apple among its top-10 holdings. \u201cThe next catalyst Apple needs to get sales growing are features like 5G. That factor went from negative to positive in the quarter because of the resolution with Qualcomm.\u201d Apple\u2019s share-repurchase plan is down slightly from last year\u2019s $100 billion commitment, which was the largest ever announced by a U.S. company, according to data from research firm Birinyi Associates. Apple has bought back $71.6 billion since announcing that prior commitment, bringing total repurchases since 2012 to nearly $275 billion. Apple didn\u2019t give a timetable for when it will fulfill the new commitment. The company\u2019s board also approved a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend to 77 cents a share, building on last year\u2019s 16% increase. Apple continues to struggle with broader economic challenges in China, where slower growth has hurt companies including 3M Co. and Intel Corp. The iPhone maker\u2019s sales from Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 22% in the just-ended fiscal second quarter, an improvement from the prior quarter. Apple recently reduced iPhone prices in China to be more competitive with lower-price handsets from rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. That bolstered sales in China during the quarter, analysts said, but iPhone shipments still fell 30% to an estimated 6.5 million units, according to Canalys, a market research firm. Mr. Cook said Apple has been helped by the Chinese government\u2019s move to stimulate the economy by reducing value-added taxes, and by a boost to consumer confidence from signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Apple also delivered 30% sales growth from its wearables division that includes its smartwatch, AirPods wireless headphones and HomePod smart speaker. Analysts project that will be a $21.76 billion business this fiscal year. The combination of wearables and services accounted for 29% of total revenue in the fiscal second quarter, while the iPhone fell to 54% of sales from its typical level of two-thirds. \u201cThank goodness for the services side of the business because if they didn\u2019t have that Apple would be a super-cyclical hardware-only company,\u201d said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgwood Partners Inc., a St. Louis-based firm with $3.1 billion that counts Apple as its third largest holding. \u201cIt\u2019s grown its ecosystem and given people more reasons to stick around.\u201d Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: 150 are how many S&P 500 constituents report earnings in the next five days It\u2019s the busiest week of the first-quarter earnings season. Two of the U.S.\u2019s biggest companies are scheduled to report. Google-parent Alphabet kicks off the week Monday, followed by Apple on Tuesday. A parade of insurers also release earnings. Humana, Cigna, Allstate, MetLife, and Prudential Financial all report this week. Thursday\u2019s highlights are the new DowDuPont and Dow chemical giants, which split into two companies on April 1. Finally a pair of Generals, meaning Motors and Electric, both report on Tuesday. It\u2019s the highest percentage in nearly five years in Barron\u2019s biannual Big Money poll of investors from around the country. U.S. stocks have had a roaring start to the year. They\u2019ve retraced all of their fourth-quarter losses, and then some. The recent exuberance has swelled investors\u2019 wallets, but shrunk their confidence in the market\u2019s ability to keep climbing. Even the bullish respondents see only modest gains for the indexes going forward. Adding more, larger organizations is a key part of the company\u2019s strategy. The workplace productivity software maker filed for a direct public listing on Friday\u2014that means the company will begin publicly trading without raising money from new investors. Pricing and timing details for the IPO haven\u2019t been revealed yet. In its filing, Slack reported annual revenue of $400 million, up more than 80% from a year ago. But losses piled up too, and the company said it expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. Numbers by Barron\u2019s is a new daily podcast. Find out more here.

        "content": "Three numbers to start your day: 12% is how much Qualcomm shares climbed on Wednesday The rally came after the chipmaker settled a long-running legal fight with Apple, which buys Qualcomm\u2019s chips for its smartphone. The legal dispute centered on the way Qualcomm was charging Apple and other clients for the use of its technology. Apple has agreed to license Qualcomm\u2019s technology for six years and pay royalties. It will also make a one-time payment of an undisclosed size to Qualcomm. \u2014between December and March, according to its latest data. Of course, the Fed\u2019s metric includes the energy industry: Think oil drilling coal mining, and other activities that vary with energy prices. But even if you leave energy out, industrial production has been flatlining since last August. That doesn\u2019t automatically mean that trouble is ahead. But taken with recent market recession signals, it could be a reason for investor caution. \u2014after it reported first-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street forecasts.Overall, the tech company\u2019s latest earnings were a mixed bag. On the one hand, it reported stronger revenues in some key software businesses. On the other, the company changed the way it reports results, which led some analysts to raise questions about profitability. Now, investors will be watching for more detail about IBM\u2019s big-ticket purchase of Red Hat, a cloud computing company. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.

        "content": "SAN DIEGO\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% agreed to dismiss all litigation between the two companies world-wide and forged a new license agreement, ending a long-brewing legal battle over how royalties are collected on innovations in smartphone technology. The settlement, which came hours after opening arguments in a trial between the companies started, includes an undisclosed payment from Apple to Qualcomm. The companies also said in a joint statement that they had reached a six-year license agreement and a multiyear deal for Qualcomm to supply Apple with modem chips. Qualcomm had claimed Apple was violating its patents by withholding royalties, while Apple argued Qualcomm had been overcharging for those patents for years, abusing its dominant position in the market. At stake was the future of Qualcomm\u2019s licensing model and billions of dollars in royalties that Apple has either paid or kept. Until the settlement was struck, Qualcomm had lost more than $25 billion in market value amid the looming threat. The emergence of fifth-generation wireless speeds as a key component of coming devices likely drove the two companies to the table. Apple\u2019s most recent iPhones have been using modem chips from Intel Corp. , which has lagged behind Qualcomm in providing wireless features. Apple also faced falling behind rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. in offering speedier wireless devices. Determining exactly who benefits by how much is difficult because the companies didn\u2019t divulge pricing or other terms of the licensing and supply deals. Qualcomm said the agreement will add about $2 in annual earnings per share as modem-chip shipments begin. More important for Qualcomm, though, the deal also removes a significant threat to its core licensing business, which has accounted for about half of the company\u2019s profit in recent years. Apple through its contract manufacturing had been withholding about $8 billion in royalties owed to Qualcomm. \u201cThis is an enormous win for Qualcomm because the suit and related suits were life-threatening to the company,\u201d said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates. \u201cFor Apple, a loss would have been financially punishing, but for Qualcomm, this would have destroyed the business. This is like a new lease on life.\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s stock skyrocketed in afternoon trading following the announcement, jumping 23% to $70.45, its highest point since last October. Apple investors reacted more modestly, with its stock closing up just 0.01% at $199.25. For Apple, the deal enables it to deploy Qualcomm\u2019s 5G chips in its phones\u2014a crucial step in order for the iPhone maker to keep pace with competitors running Android software. Until this point, Apple\u2019s legal challenge had left it without access to those market-leading 5G modem chips, putting its most important product, the iPhone, a step behind Android competitors in the race to the next big advance in wireless. Apple and Qualcomm spokeswomen declined to comment beyond the companies\u2019 joint statement. The legal battle over how royalties are collected on smartphone-technology innovations spanned more than two years across three continents, costing the companies millions of dollars in legal fees. The discord was fueled by two chief executives\u2014 Tim Cook of Apple and Steve Mollenkopf of Qualcomm\u2014who had a distant relationship and were entrenched in their competing positions. Both CEOs were expected to testify in the coming weeks. As Apple escalated its fight and began withholding royalties about two years ago, Mr. Mollenkopf made a bet to accelerate more than $500 million in spending on 5G technology, people close to Qualcomm said. The move helped Qualcomm begin delivering 5G modem chips to Samsung and others early this year, increasing pressure on Apple as its Android rivals moved to the next generation of wireless, these people said. Apple\u2019s primary modem-chip supplier, Intel, was at least a year behind Qualcomm in developing a 5G modem chip. Hours after Tuesday\u2019s settlement announcement, Intel said it would abandon efforts to develop 5G chips for smartphones, citing \u201cno clear path to profitability.\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s board pushed Mr. Mollenkopf for months to get on the same page as Apple and resolve the dispute, another person close to the company said. The two companies remained in contact throughout the dispute, people close to Qualcomm said. However, serious talks didn\u2019t start until just before the trial began on Monday, according to these people and others close to the events. Qualcomm and Apple executives then began shuttling back and forth between the companies\u2019 respective headquarters in San Diego and Cupertino, Calif., they said. The parties aimed to announce a deal prior to jury selection on Monday but negotiations spilled into Tuesday morning, after opening arguments began, they said. Attorneys for Apple and Qualcomm were kept at arm\u2019s length from the negotiations so they could continue to prepare for the trial, according to attorneys working on the case. The dramatic turn of events on Tuesday came as the two sides traded barbs during opening remarks in front of a nine-person jury at a federal court in San Diego, about 15 miles from Qualcomm\u2019s headquarters. Prior to Qualcomm\u2019s opening arguments, Apple\u2019s lawyers sought to portray the chip company as a monopolist that had used its patent portfolio to charge onerous licensing fees of 5% of the sales price of iPhones sold world-wide, with the fee amounts capped at $400 a phone. To press that case, attorney Ruffin Cordell of Fish & Richardson, which represented Apple, turned to the business of fried chicken. He compared Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices to someone showing up at a KFC restaurant to order chicken but being told to get an \u201ceating license\u201d from the fast-food chain first, because the chicken includes Colonel Sanders\u2019s secret recipe. Imagine, he said, the license costs $17 and the bucket of chicken costs $17. Qualcomm\u2019s lawyer, Evan Chesler, disputed that notion, saying that Qualcomm\u2019s business practices were more akin to a KFC that charged one price for a bucket of fried chicken and another price for a side of potatoes. Mr. Chesler had about 15 minutes left in his closing remarks when CNBC reported that the parties had reached an agreement to settle their dispute. Mr. Chesler finished his comments and then the lawyers held a conference with the judge. A news release declaring the truce soon followed. The agreement will \u201callow these tech companies to get back to business and you to return to your everyday affairs,\u201d Judge Gonzalo Curiel told the jurors. The KFC analogy became a running joke between the parties as soon as the trial ended. Apple\u2019s head of litigation, Noreen Krall, and Mr. Chesler, Qualcomm\u2019s lead attorney, shared an elevator after the trial. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go get some Kentucky Fried Chicken,\u201d Ms. Krall said, grinning. \u201cAnd potatoes!\u201d Mr. Chesler said.",

        "content": "Apple Music has surpassed Spotify Technology SA SPOT 0.79% in paid U.S. subscriptions, according to people familiar with the matter, in a shift that escalates the music rivals\u2019 contest for listeners world-wide. Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s streaming-music service has been adding subscribers in the world\u2019s biggest music market more rapidly than its Swedish rival\u2014a monthly growth rate of about 2.6% to 3%, compared with 1.5% to 2% for Spotify\u2014the people said. Apple Music had more than 28 million subscribers in the U.S. as of February, compared with Spotify\u2019s 26 million, the people said. Neither service publicly breaks out regional subscriber counts, and those figures include only paying users, excluding those in trial offerings that the companies can count in their public subscriber disclosures. Including nonpaying listeners of its ad-supported tier, who generate a fraction of the revenue subscribers do, Spotify has more users overall in the U.S. Apple was expected to reach its milestone more than six months ago, but Spotify intensified efforts to maintain its lead, expanding various promotions including a discounted subscription bundle with video-streaming service Hulu. More recently, the Swedish company filed an antitrust complaint in Europe claiming Apple abuses its control over the App Store to advantage the iPhone maker\u2019s service, something Apple denies. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services. Meanwhile, Spotify said in February that it agreed to buy podcaster Gimlet Media, with which The Wall Street Journal also has a content partnership. Spotify remains far ahead of Apple globally. As of December, Spotify said it had 207 million active users around the world, 96 million of whom are paying subscribers or in a trial period leading to a subscription. The rest of Spotify\u2019s active users have opted for a free, ad-supported version of the service. Apple, which doesn\u2019t offer a free, ad-supported option, has more than 50 million paying subscribers. The growth of Apple Music is one of the strongest validations yet of Apple\u2019s strategy to increase revenue by selling services across its devices\u2014a shift after decades of focusing on hardware sales. Last week, the technology company announced new subscription offerings for magazines, TV shows and videogames. The push into subscriptions comes as Apple\u2019s bread-and-butter iPhone business struggles. In January, the company reported its first decline in sales and profits for the holiday period after iPhone sales fell 15% to $52 billion. Services, which includes streaming-music subscriptions, device insurance and mobile payments, blunted those declines, rising 19% to $10.88 billion in the period. As streaming has become the most popular way people listen to music\u2014and the most lucrative source of growth for the recording industry\u2014subscriptions have become the most closely watched metric for the services competing to grow market share. Apple Music is growing faster globally\u2014at a rate of about 2.4% to 2.8%, compared with Spotify\u2019s 2% to 2.3%\u2014and the gap is starting to close in other markets outside the U.S., according to the people familiar with the numbers. Apple Music\u2019s momentum is particularly pronounced in the other large, English-speaking territories where iTunes, the company\u2019s music-download store, was popular and where iPhone usage is high. Apple has used its devices\u2019 popularity to attract music-streaming users. The Apple Music app comes preloaded on iPhones and other Apple hardware. The company has a base of about 101 million active iPhones in the U.S., according to Strategy Analytics, a market research firm. The service is also available on Android devices and has been installed about 40 million times world-wide from the Google Play store, according to the app-tracking firm Sensor Tower. Offers tying subscriptions to mobile-phone services have also helped Apple make significant inroads. For example, the company this month joined with Verizon Communications Inc. to provide six months of Apple Music free to new and current customers. It has used its marketing muscle to accelerate subscriptions, spending twice as much as Spotify on TV ads in the U.S. since 2016, with spots during National Football League games, awards shows and other big events, according to ad measurement firm iSpot.tv. Spotify, which went public last year, has responded with offerings of its own, including an offer of free Hulu access with premium subscriptions. It also has extended discounts\u2014three months of its premium service for 99 cents\u2014that drive much of its subscriber growth, according to people familiar with the matter. The streaming-music service is trying to counter Apple\u2019s distribution advantage of 1.4 billion active devices through an agreement struck in August with Samsung Electronics Co. , making Spotify the default music service across the South Korean company\u2019s phones, TVs and speakers. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, on a call with analysts last year, played down the competition among streaming-music providers, pointing instead to the potential size of the subscriber market. Despite its growth, Apple\u2019s streaming-music business isn\u2019t expected to lift company profits. Costs associated with paying labels, publishers and artists means the service has a gross margin of roughly 15%, the lowest of any of Apple\u2019s services, according to RBC Capital Markets. \u201cFrom Apple\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re not looking at this business for overall dollars,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with the technology firm Creative Strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s about making the value of their hardware go up.\u201d",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% each notched victories from a U.S. trade body in their yearslong feud over patent licensing, hardening the divide between them ahead of a federal trial slated to begin next month. Apple netted the more significant victory Tuesday, with a ruling by members of the U.S. International Trade Commission that the iPhone maker didn\u2019t violate a patent held by its former chip supplier. That ruling effectively overturned an ITC administrative judge\u2019s finding in September that Apple had violated a Qualcomm patent related to power efficiency in mobile phones. A less-definitive decision came just hours earlier from another ITC administrative judge in a separate patent claim by Qualcomm. In that case, the judge issued an initial finding against Apple and recommended a limited ban on iPhone imports. That recommendation is still subject to review by the ITC\u2014a six-member group that currently has one open slot\u2014and potentially by the Trump administration. Qualcomm said it would ask the ITC to reconsider the commissioners\u2019 ruling because it was inconsistent with a recent jury finding that Apple infringed on the same patent at issue in that case. Qualcomm said the ITC judge\u2019s interim finding affirmed the value of Qualcomm\u2019s technologies. An Apple spokesman said the ITC\u2019s finding that Qualcomm\u2019s patent claim was invalid was an important step to preserving fair competition. He added, \u201cWe look forward to detailing the many ways they\u2019re harming consumers and stifling innovation when we present our case in San Diego next month.\u201d Shares of Qualcomm ended Tuesday\u2019s regular trading session up 2.4%, but slid slightly after hours following news of the second decision. Apple shares ended down 1%, then edged up after hours. Qualcomm\u2019s complaints against Apple to the ITC are part of a world-spanning legal battle between the companies that could determine how much revenue Apple must share from its most important product at a time of slowing global smartphone sales. The fight started in early 2017, when Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court in San Diego, alleging the chip maker extracted extortionate rates for patent licenses by leveraging its dominance in the modem-chip market. That trial is set to start next month. The legal tug of war has cost both sides millions of dollars, and with neither side ascendant, both are digging in. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed suit against Qualcomm in 2017, focusing on the chip company\u2019s allegedly monopolistic practices. Qualcomm, which denies the claims and says its pricing practices are fair, has countered by alleging that Apple violated its patents in Germany, China, the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Judge Lucy Koh, who is overseeing the FTC case, is expected to make a decision in the coming weeks. In a separate case brought by Qualcomm, a jury in San Diego this month found that Apple violated the same Qualcomm patent that ITC commissioners on Tuesday ruled it didn\u2019t violate. The jury awarded Qualcomm $31 million in damages for Apple\u2019s violation of three patents. Qualcomm long supplied Apple with modem chips, which handle wireless connectivity to mobile networks. But in the widening battle between the companies, Apple stopped using the Qualcomm chips after the iPhone XS\u2019s release in 2018. Qualcomm had filed both of its ITC cases in 2017, arguing that Apple was violating patents covering techniques to handle data efficiently and extend battery life on mobile phones. The ITC administrative judge\u2019s decision on Tuesday means Apple may not be out of the woods. Judge MaryJoan McNamara recommended that some iPhones be barred from import, although her two-page order didn\u2019t specify which iPhone models it covered. Even if the ITC commissioners agree with Judge McNamara\u2019s decision, the White House could step in before any import ban takes place. Presidents have vetoed ITC moves before, including in 2013 when the Obama administration prevented an ITC ban on the sale of some iPhones and iPads from taking effect after Samsung Electronics Co. won a case.",

The announcements Monday mark a strategic shift for Apple as it seeks new momentum amid softening sales in its core iPhone business. The centerpiece of the star-studded event at Apple\u2019s headquarters, capped by an appearance by Oprah Winfrey, was a new video-subscription service to carry original programming. In a first for the company, it plans to make its TV app, which will carry that content, available on competitors\u2019 televisions and other devices as well as its own\u2014reflecting Apple\u2019s growing ambition to go beyond selling its own gadgets. Apple also announced Apple Card, a mainly digital credit card launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that aims to challenge incumbents by offering low interest rates and eliminating both late fees and annual fees. It unveiled Apple News+, a $9.99 monthly service that provides access to 300-plus magazines as well as newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal through an agreement with parent Dow Jones & Co. And it showed off Apple Arcade, a gaming subscription service offering access to 100-plus exclusive games for an unspecified monthly fee. Chief Executive Tim Cook portrayed the services as an extension of Apple\u2019s existing mix of products, saying the integration of hardware, software and services is something Apple does better than anyone else. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to extend our services even further, making them even more entertaining, more useful and more informative,\u201d he said. A look at the services announced by Apple on Monday. APPLE NEWS+ A news-subscription service that offers access to more than 300 magazines, newspapers (including The Wall Street Journal) and digital publications. Costs $9.99 a month. APPLE CARD A new credit card that includes Goldman Sachs and Mastercard as partners APPLE ARCADE A game-subscription service with more than 100 exclusive games. No pricing information released. APPLE TV+ A video-subscription service featuring original content. Pricing details to come this fall. The initiatives are part of a broader movement by tech titans to spread into new industries, betting their combination of loyal users and troves of data can help unlock revenue opportunities. The efforts are fueling competition in new arenas between some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, as Amazon.com Inc. pushes beyond e-commerce into entertainment and finance and Alphabet Inc. goes past advertising into subscription gaming. The tech companies are applying their digital expertise to established industries just as Apple did years ago with the music business, said Bob O\u2019Donnell, president at Technalysis Research. \u201cA lot of the markets they\u2019re currently in are peaking, so to maintain growth and satisfy investors they have to extend their reach,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s success in its new bets isn\u2019t guaranteed, and the company didn\u2019t disclose important details Monday that could shed more light on its odds, including pricing for the video-content and gaming services. Apple faces stiff competition in areas where it is expanding, including from existing entertainment and credit-card players and from companies providing free news and videogames. Apple shares closed down 1.2% on Monday. They have gained ground this year despite a sharp drop in iPhone sales at the end of last year but remain well below their record high from last October. The new video-content plans thrust Apple into rapidly intensifying competition among technology companies and traditional cable operators for pay-TV users. Growing disillusionment with cable companies and the rise of streaming-subscription services like Netflix Inc. is leading millions of Americans to change their pay-TV habits, allowing companies like Amazon, Sony Corp. and Hulu to elbow into a $100 billion industry long dominated by Comcast Corp. , AT&T Inc. \u2019s DirecTV and others. Apple\u2019s revamped TV app unveiled Monday\u2014which will house the new video-content service\u2014is designed to grab a share of that splintering TV market. A May software update will turn the app into a central portal where customers can use a single password to subscribe to content from AT&T\u2019s HBO, CBS Corp. \u2019s Showtime and others. That will put it most directly in competition with Amazon, which is spending billions of dollars a year on content to compete with Netflix while also acting as a distributor for channels like HBO. Apple\u2019s original-content service, called TV+, will be available in its TV app starting in the fall. Though the company only showed brief footage from its original series, it brought out several stars and directors to discuss their work with Apple, including Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Ms. Winfrey cited the broad audience of people with Apple devices as one reason she is working with the company. \u201cThe Apple platform allows me to do what I do in a whole new way, to take everything I\u2019ve learned about connecting with people to the next level because they\u2019re in a billion pockets, y\u2019all, a billion pockets,\u201d she said. Still, Apple acknowledged that to truly compete in services, it needs to do something it hasn\u2019t done before and bring its TV app to non-Apple hardware, including smart TV devices from Samsung Electronics Co. , LG Electronics Inc., Vizio Inc., Roku Inc., Sony and Amazon. The broader distribution is designed to help in an already crowded content marketplace. There were 496 scripted original series in 2018, according to research from Walt Disney Co. \u2019s FX Network. Streaming services including Netflix and Amazon are driving that surge in programming. Since 2014, the number of streaming shows has grown nearly 40%, according to FX. The competition has driven the cost of content sky high as programmers are spending heavily to lock down major producers. Apple committed $1 billion to create original shows, an amount that pales in comparison to what Netflix, HBO and others spend annually. While streaming services are growing as more consumers cut the cords to their traditional pay-TV services, it isn\u2019t clear whether the marketplace can sustain the volume of content being produced. \u201cThere\u2019s potential in a future Apple mega-bundle, but today, their announcement was mostly about creating an offering and experience largely identical to the one Amazon has had for years,\u201d said Matthew Ball, an independent consultant and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios. The launch of Apple Card, which customers will sign up for on their iPhones, marks a major expansion of the tech giant\u2019s foray into financial services, begun in 2014 with Apple Pay. The card uses machine-learning on Apple\u2019s devices to organize people\u2019s spending behavior into summaries. Customers can receive a physical, titanium card to use in locations where Apple Pay isn\u2019t yet accepted. The news app, called Apple News+, is a premium version of the existing, free Apple News app. Available immediately in the U.S., it provides access to articles from magazines including Vogue, GQ and Sports Illustrated, as well as newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and the Journal. Publishers will split revenue from the app 50/50 with Apple, according to people familiar with the agreements. \u201cWe believe in the power of journalism and the impact it can have on our lives,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe think Apple News+ is going to be great for customers and great for publishers.\u201d Apple emphasized the privacy of its new services, saying it won\u2019t track articles people read, purchases they make or games they play. The company recently released a TV advertisement touting its position on privacy as it looks to differentiate its offerings from competitors like Google and Facebook Inc.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% on Wednesday unveiled a new version of its AirPods wireless earbuds that can activate the virtual assistant Siri by voice, an added feature aimed at extending the momentum of a fast-selling device as iPhone sales cool. The tech giant is under pressure to build up new areas of business as growth in its bread-and-butter smartphone business sputters. With people holding on to iPhones longer, Apple is looking to a combination of services and wearable devices. The releases come ahead of an event next Monday at Apple\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, where the company is expected to introduce new services, including its first original TV shows and a news-subscription service. The second generation of AirPods, which Apple said connect to iPhones faster and with a new chip increase talk time to about three hours, could help accelerate its wearables business, whose revenue rose 35% last year to $17.38 billion. The category, which includes AirPods and Apple Watch, remains just 6.5% of total revenue. The iPhone accounts for two-thirds of the company\u2019s sales. A downturn in iPhone demand late last year forced Apple to slash its quarterly revenue guidance for the first time in more than 15 years. Apple said the new wireless earbuds will hit stores next week. It is offering a version with a traditional-charging case for $159, the same price as the original set, and a version with a wireless-charging case for $199. The earbuds incorporate a new H1 chip, replacing the W1 wireless chip that powered the first-generation AirPods, which were announced in 2016. The company earlier this year approved production of a wireless-charging pad called AirPower, according to people familiar with the matter. It had announced the product in late 2017. AirPower, which would allow users to charge the new AirPods and an iPhone simultaneously, has been delayed by product-development challenges, the people said. Apple typically announces new products within months of beginning production. AirPods were announced the same year Apple eliminated the headphone jack in its newest iPhones and immediately faced criticism on social media for looking like Q-Tips. However, tech reviewers praised them for freeing people from the tangle of wired headphones and being easy to use.",

        "content": "NEW ORLEANS--A massive new study found that the pulse sensor in Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s watch helped detect a heart-rhythm disorder in a small number of users but may have caused false alarms for others. The study\u2019s mixed findings hinted at the potential of \u201cwearable\u201d gadgets to detect asymptomatic health conditions in people that might otherwise go unnoticed. But doctors said the potential false positives and other aspects of the study show that people should be cautious about relying on the technology as diagnostic tools. \u201cThe wearable sensors, I think we have a ways to go,\u201d Dr. Richard Kovacs, professor of cardiology at Indiana University School of Medicine and incoming president of the American College of Cardiology, said in an interview at the ACC\u2019s annual meeting in New Orleans, where the study was presented Saturday. With funding from Apple, researchers from Stanford University started the \u201cApple Heart Study\u201d in 2017 and eventually enrolled nearly 420,000 American adults who owned an Apple Watch and an iPhone. A majority were under the age of 40, but nearly 25,000 people were at least 65\u2014the primary at-risk age group for irregular-heartbeat conditions. Participants could enroll in the study by downloading an app on the iPhone. The study is a sign of Apple\u2019s ambitions to push into the large U.S. health-care market. The optical pulse sensor on Apple\u2019s watch picks up heart rates, and researchers explored whether that tool could detect irregular heartbeats known as atrial fibrillation, a condition that can increase one\u2019s risk for stroke. Up to six million Americans are estimated to have atrial fibrillation, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many don\u2019t experience symptoms, which can leave the condition undetected. Patients can take blood-thinning drugs to try to ward off strokes, though these drugs carry risks of causing bleeding. Participants in the Stanford study used older versions of Apple\u2019s watch, not the latest version unveiled in September, which added a built-in electrocardiogram to the pulse sensor. In the study, if Apple\u2019s watch picked up suspected atrial fibrillation, it displayed a written notification to the user. Users could then use the study app on their iPhones to get a live video consultation with doctors helping to run the study. The doctors advised any participants experiencing serious symptoms to get immediate treatment. But if there were no symptoms beyond the watch notification, researchers mailed electrocardiogram patches for participants to wear on their chests for one week, to confirm whether they had atrial fibrillation. ECG\u2019s, traditionally given in medical offices, record heart rhythm and electrical activity and can more definitively diagnose atrial fibrillation. The study ended in August 2018. In all, only about 2,160 people, or 0.5% of study participants, received notifications of irregular heart rhythms. The rate was higher in people 65 and older\u20143.2%, verus 0.16% in people ages 22 to 39. Of those notified by the watch, only about 450 people received and returned the wearable ECG patches to the researchers. Some didn\u2019t get patches because they didn\u2019t call the study doctor, or they revealed they had previously been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which disqualified them from the study, said Marco Perez, an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford and one of the study leaders, in an interview. Researchers found that the ECG patches confirmed atrial fibrillation in only 34% of the 450 people who returned patches. The remaining two-thirds had no confirmed atrial fibrillation during the time they wore the patches\u2014raising questions about the watch\u2019s accuracy. Renato Lopes, professor of at Duke University School of Medicine, said the watch has potential to detect some atrial-fibrillation cases \u201cyou would not get otherwise.\u201d But in a panel discussion after results were presented, he said the 34% confirmation rate was \u201cnot very high.\u201d Dr. Perez of Stanford said episodes of atrial fibrillation can be intermittent, which could help explain why a big proportion of ECG patch wearers had no confirmed atrial fibrillation during the week they wore it. Doctors at the ACC meeting expressed concern that widespread use of the watch would lead people to undergo unnecessary tests and treatment, either because of false alarms or because they have atrial fibrillation that carries a lower risk of complications. Patients with lower-risk cases can be monitored instead of immediately undergoing treatment with blood thinners, doctors say. \u201cThis also has the possibility to lead a lot of patients potentially to being treated unnecessarily or prematurely, or flooding doctors\u2019 offices and cardiologists\u2019 offices with a lot of young people,\u201d Jeanne Poole, professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, said during the panel discussion after the results were presented Cost is another issue: The latest versions of the watch start at $399, while the previous model starts at $279. Doctors said more research is needed on the cost-effectiveness of the use of the watches to find heart problems. Measured another way, Dr. Perez said the likelihood that the watch detected atrial fibrillation as confirmed by the ECG patch was 84%, but this analysis was conducted in a smaller group, among 86 participants who received positive watch notifications of irregular heartbeats. The Stanford researchers acknowledged the study\u2019s limitations\u2014it lacked a control arm and didn\u2019t track patient outcomes such as stroke. And statistically, it didn\u2019t meet researchers\u2019 goals for confidence in some of the key measures. But they said it is a start in helping to assess the usefulness of wearable technologies. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some important measurements that are then going to be able to be used by clinicians to help guide what they want to do with the patient in front of them who has been notified,\u201d said Dr. Perez. Sumbul Desai, a Stanford professor and vice president of health at Apple, said the watch\u2019s heartbeat tracker isn\u2019t intended to be a diagnostic or screening tool. \u201cI view the Apple Heart Study as just a first step,\u201d she said in a panel discussion. She said Apple planned further research to better understand the medical value of the watch, including a new study in partnership with Johnson & Johnson announced in January.",

        "content": "Music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA SPOT 0.79% has filed an antitrust complaint in Europe against Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% a new salvo in the broader battle over whether and how to rein in global tech giants. Spotify\u2019s complaint, filed late Monday to the European Union\u2019s antitrust arm, alleges that Apple in recent years has abused its control over which apps appear in its App Store with the aim of limiting competition with its streaming service Apple Music. Spotify claims Apple made it difficult for rival subscription services to market themselves to users without using Apple\u2019s payment system, which generally takes a 30% cut of transactions. Spotify said its app doesn\u2019t face the same restrictions in the Play store operated by Alphabet Inc. GOOG 0.03% \u2019s Google. The European company also said Apple at times rejected security updates of its app and threatened to kick it out of the App Store for allegedly anticompetitive reasons. \u201cApps should compete on merits, not who owns the app store,\u201d said Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s general counsel. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU\u2019s antitrust enforcer, confirmed that it had received the Spotify complaint, \u201cwhich we are assessing under our standard procedures.\u201d Spotify\u2019s antitrust filing, the first disclosed about Apple\u2019s App Store at the EU level, escalates the global battle over how to regulate tech giants on issues ranging from privacy and taxation to hate speech and competition. The European Commission in 2016 ordered Apple to repay $14.5 billion in tax breaks to Ireland\u2014earning EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager the nickname \u201ctax lady\u201d from President Trump\u2014and over the following two years fined Google a total of $7.7 billion for alleged anticompetitive behavior. The commission also has implemented a strict new privacy law that has spawned many investigations; and it is close to approving new copyright rules aimed at making tech giants pay more money to music companies and news organizations. Central to these battles is a basic question: What responsibilities should be placed on companies that serve millions of businesses and billions of consumers with services that in the eyes of many have become essential? Activists and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic argue that big tech companies are now like utilities, and should be regulated as such. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, went further last week, calling for the breakup of such companies as Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. Under particular scrutiny are companies that operate platforms used by thousands of other businesses. For instance, the EU last year opened a preliminary probe into whether Amazon is unfairly competing against merchants that sell goods via its retail site. The EU also is close to approving new rules forcing platforms operators to be more transparent and predictable in the terms they offer companies using their service. Mr. Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s general counsel, hit on that point Wednesday. \u201cOnce Apple became not only a platform provider, but also a direct competitor, their incentive to disadvantage rival services, like Spotify, became even greater and their restrictions started to become more frequent and extreme,\u201d he said. The U.K. on Wednesday weighed in on the issue of tech dominance, as it published a report from a government-appointed panel recommending tighter antitrust oversight of the sector. Spotify, one of Europe\u2019s biggest tech successes, had complained informally to the EU several times about such issues in recent years. In late 2017, for instance, the company and other streaming firms sent the EU a letter criticizing the way both Apple and Google operate their app stores. A spokesman for Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Deezer, which was among those music-streaming firms that complained in 2017, on Wednesday said it supported Spotify in its antitrust challenge and looked forward to the commission\u2019s response. The current commission will reach the end of its term later this year, following EU parliamentary elections in May, leaving little time to make significant progress on a new investigation. Spotify didn\u2019t rule out pursuing the antitrust issue in the U.S., as well. The European company\u2019s complaint comes as Apple accelerates efforts to expand its services business, which includes App Store sales, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments. The company is holding an event on March 25 where it is expected to announce additional services for original video programming, as well as magazines and publishing outlets. Services have emerged as a bright spot for the company amid sinking iPhone sales. The business\u2019s sales have grown by more than 20% annually the past three years, approaching $40 billion in the latest fiscal year, or 15% of Apple\u2019s total income. In addition to the Spotify complaint, Apple faces other challenges to the business. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the propriety of a lawsuit brought by consumers who allege the company illegally monopolized the sale of iPhone apps. A ruling in favor of plaintiffs in the case, Apple v. Pepper, could allow consumers to sue Apple over its practice of taking a 30% cut of the apps it sells, which plaintiffs argue inflated prices because Apple\u2019s store is the only place the apps can be purchased. In a blog post Wednesday, Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek said Apple\u2019s rules \u201cpurposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience\u2014essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.\u201d \u2014 Anne Steele in Los Angeles and Tripp Mickle in San Francisco contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% executives came to a group of big banks in 2017 with a problem. The technology giant had been relying on a patchwork of smaller banks to allow Apple\u2019s customers to lease iPhones, store cash in digital wallets and text money to friends. Apple wanted a new partner to rethink the business, according to people familiar with the process. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others pitched their services, the people said. Apple instead went with a name little known on Main Street: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -0.31% The elite investment bank will soon roll out an Apple credit card that will sync with an iPhone app, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. The card is part of a broader partnership between Apple and Goldman to offer financial advice and products to millions of iPhone users. The collaboration will be closely watched by rivals in both Silicon Valley and Wall Street that are puzzling through the messy collision of finance and technology. The biggest banks, though wary of powerful tech companies, are also eager to not be left behind by them. Neither Apple nor Goldman has much experience in consumer finance. But Apple is a colossus, with billions in cash and cultish fans. Goldman has a $933 billion balance sheet and a willingness to take chances that rivals won\u2019t as it builds a retail-banking business from scratch. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got a whole new competitor that\u2019s larger than anyone else in financial services\u201d in clout and global reach, said Mal Durkee, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker who has advised banks, regulators and financial-tech startups. \u201cIt\u2019s game on.\u201d Tech companies are venturing deeper into financial services, betting the combination of a loyal user base and trove of data can unlock new revenue opportunities. In just the U.S. credit-card and payments market, the annual revenue pool is roughly $500 billion, according to Bernstein Research. Financial regulations, though, mean they can\u2019t do it alone. They need banks, and that regulatory wrinkle is leading to unexpected partnerships between industry titans like Apple and Goldman, which typically prefer to operate alone. Other examples are sure to follow. Amazon.com Inc. last year talked to banks about building its own checking-account-like product, the Journal reported at the time. The strategy was a bet that people who shop on Amazon.com, get groceries at its Whole Foods stores and listen to Amazon\u2019s streaming music service on the company\u2019s Alexa devices might want to do their banking with the company, too. Tech companies both new and old are burrowing deeper into finance. Square Inc., the financial-technology firm known for its white credit-card readers that plug into smartphones, filed paperwork in December to open its own bank in Utah. Intuit Inc. offers loans to businesses that use its accounting software. \u201cPeople need to store money, move money and borrow money,\u201d said Frank Rotman, a venture capitalist at QED Investors and a former Capital One Financial Corp. executive. \u201cIf there\u2019s a strategic rationale for a tech company to do any of those three things, they need to become a bank or partner with one.\u201d Goldman can\u2019t do it on its own either. It is new to consumer banking, having spent most of its 150-year history catering to big companies and billionaires. Without branches, it needs other ways to find customers for its online savings and lending business. Apple, too, needs new engines of growth as iPhone sales slow. Its mobile-payment system, Apple Pay, has been slow to catch on in a crowded field. Only one-quarter of U.S. iPhone users have activated Apple Pay, and mobile payments accounted for an estimated 1% of the $39.75 billion in services revenue that Apple reported for its latest fiscal year, estimates Loup Ventures, an investment and research firm. Apple has been putting more of its resources toward financial services. Jennifer Bailey, the executive who is in charge of Apple Pay, was tasked with overhauling the company\u2019s fragmented banking relationships, which had become a point of frustration inside Apple, people familiar with the matter said. A regional bank in Rhode Island extended loans to U.S. customers buying the latest iPhone. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Barclays PLC offered similar loans in Britain. A third bank managed the cash that Apple Pay users kept in their accounts. And Apple\u2019s rewards credit card was issued by Barclays. In 2017, Apple sought to consolidate some of those relationships, people familiar with the matter said. Citigroup held detailed talks with Apple that year about a partnership, people familiar with the talks said. The companies discussed spinning technology used by Citigroup\u2019s consumer bank, which has 18 million digital users, into a new app, the people said. But Goldman won in part because it is a newcomer. It agreed to build features that Apple wanted because it doesn\u2019t have existing credit-card partners that might be angered, people familiar with the process said. \u201cBanks that are big in credit cards have all these existing relationships\u201d with airlines, retailers and other clients, said Scott Samlin, a lawyer at Pepper Hamilton LLP who advises banks. \u201cI\u2019m sure there would be objections.\u201d That Goldman has been Apple\u2019s investment bank of choice helped its case, too, the people said. Goldman led Apple\u2019s $17 billion bond sale in 2013, at the time the biggest corporate offering ever, and has advised Apple on deals. Apple\u2019s corporate-development team is stacked with Goldman alums, too.",

        "content": "Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% hoping to revitalize sales in China, has paired up with the world\u2019s largest financial-technology company to give iPhone buyers an affordable purchase option: up to two years of interest-free financing. Apple and Alipay, a popular Chinese mobile-payments network owned by Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Financial Services Group, this week informed customers that they could borrow money at no cost to buy products on Apple\u2019s online store and pay for the devices in monthly installments over 24 months. The minimum purchase to qualify for the interest-free financing is 4,000 yuan ($595). On Apple\u2019s China website, the cost of an iPhone 8 starts at 5,099 yuan ($758) while the iPhone XR, a new handset released last fall that the company hoped would sell well in China, has a starting price of 6,499 yuan ($967). Apple last month blamed declining iPhone sales in China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market, for the company\u2019s first cut to its quarterly revenue estimate in more than a decade. The Cupertino, Calif., technology giant has been losing ground to Chinese rivals that sell smartphones for far less, and has also pointed to weaker economic and consumer sentiment in China. Apple\u2019s smartphone shipments in China fell 20% in the quarter ended December from a year earlier, according to International Data Corp. The new financing offer from Ant\u2019s Huabei service, which provides lines of credit to tens of millions of individuals who use the Alipay platform, will sharply lower the monthly sums that people have to pay for new iPhones. Apple offered a similar financing package at its 42 physical stores in China last month to buyers of new iPhones. Huabei, which means \u201cjust spend\u201d in Chinese, on Wednesday told customers that it could temporarily increase their credit limits to enable them to purchase Apple products. While such loans are interest-free for shoppers and can spur them to make big-ticket purchases, retailers are in effect footing the financing costs. In such arrangements, retailers typically pay lenders an upfront fee that is a small percentage of a product\u2019s price. Consumers then repay the lenders over time. An Ant spokesman declined to comment on the terms of the company\u2019s arrangements with Apple. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple\u2019s website said holders of credit cards issued by three state-owned Chinese banks can also obtain 24-month interest-free financing to purchase its products. Credit-card penetration in China, however, is low compared with the U.S. Apple\u2019s own digital-wallet service, Apple Pay, has also failed to gain traction in the country since its launch three years ago. Instead, hundreds of millions of Chinese have connected their bank accounts directly to Alipay and rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. \u2019s WeChat Pay networks and use their phones to make online and offline purchases. Ant\u2019s Alipay has more than 700 million active users in China. Its Huabei service, which operates like a virtual credit card, is used by shoppers to fund everything from daily spending to online purchases on the websites of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which created Alipay more than a decade ago and spun it off into a separate company. As many as one out of four Chinese aged 30 or younger are users of Huabei, according to a 2017 report from Ant, which also noted that most of these users prefer to pay by installment when purchasing mobile phones. Apple has a store on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall online marketplace, where Huabei users have been able to get interest-free financing for one year to purchase iPhones and other Apple products. The current 24-month financing offer ends on March 25, Apple told users of Alipay. To boost flagging sales in China, Apple has also been offering discounts on some of its new iPhones for customers who trade in older ones. For instance, the iPhone XR can be purchased for 4,399 yuan, lower than its sticker price of 6,499 yuan. The higher-end iPhone XS can be bought for 6,599 yuan with a trade-in, compared with its regular 8,699 yuan retail price. \u2014Yoko Kubota and Tripp Mickle contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% plugged a major flaw in its FaceTime video-chat software Thursday, and said it would pay a 14-year-old from Arizona for reporting the problem. Grant Thompson, a freshman at Tucson\u2019s Catalina Foothills High School, found the bug a little more than two weeks ago as he chatted with friends while playing the videogame \u201cFortnite.\u201d His mother, Michele Thompson, spent the better part of a week unsuccessfully trying to notify the tech giant of the flaw. The bug was a serious one: It allowed one FaceTime user calling another in a group chat to listen in\u2014or even see video\u2014while the recipient\u2019s Apple device was still ringing. Apple last week apologized for the flaw, an embarrassing vulnerability for a company that heavily markets the security and privacy of its devices. The bug caught the attention of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, who said the state would investigate. Apple said it plans to compensate the Thompson family and will make a gift toward Grant\u2019s education. It declined to say how much it will pay. Apple runs a \u201cbug bounty\u201d program that in some cases can pay up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to researchers reporting bugs. Apple also credited a second person, Daven Morris, a software developer from Arlington, Texas, with reporting the issue. Mr. Morris, 27, reported the bug to Apple on Sunday, Jan. 27, several days after the Thompsons. In an interview, Mr Morris said that he\u2019d discovered the bug a week earlier, while planning a group trip with friends. After learning of the bug last week, Apple disabled its Group FaceTime feature, which was the source of the bug, and began work on a patch for the issue. While researching the FaceTime flaw, Apple also discovered a bug in FaceTime\u2019s Live Photos feature. The company said Thursday it has patched this bug, too, and has disabled Live Photos for people using unpatched versions of FaceTime. It didn\u2019t provide details about the flaw. Apple had dispatched a software-engineering manager to visit Grant and his mother to thank them for their efforts and learn about their experience in trying to report the bug, Ms. Thompson said in an interview last Friday. Ms. Thompson pulled her son from his steel-drums class to meet the visitor. \u201cHe was pretty excited to meet with someone from Apple,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked him a few questions, such as \u2018When are you coming out with your AirPod 2s?\u2019\u201d \u201cThe answer was \u2018Apple does not comment on future products,\u2019\u201d Ms. Thompson said.",

Only 38 million shares were purchased during the period, according to Apple\u2019s quarterly filing. That follows a binge in which Apple bought back a little over 342 million shares during the first nine months of the year\u2014nearly four times as much as a year earlier. Apple\u2019s buybacks represented about 6% of the stock\u2019s total trading volume in first nine months of 2018. But the final quarter is when the stock needed help. Apple\u2019s share price lost more than 30% of its value in that period following the company\u2019s quarterly report on Nov. 1 that raised considerable worries about the new iPhone cycle. Yet about 82% of the quarter\u2019s repurchases took place before that report. Perhaps Apple didn\u2019t feel safe catching its own falling knife.",

        "content": "A German court dismissed four patent lawsuits from Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% against Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% the second victory this month for the tech giant in a continued global legal battle with the chip maker. The regional court in the city of Munich Thursday rejected Qualcomm\u2019s claims that Apple had infringed on its patents related to some search capabilities on the iPhone. The court has hasn\u2019t yet reached a decision on four further search-related patent disputes. Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel for Qualcomm, said the company disagrees with the court\u2019s ruling on Thursday. Apple said in a statement, \u201cWe thank the court for their time and diligence in this case.\u201d Thursday\u2019s ruling is part of a series of global patent disputes between the two companies\u2014which have had mixed results to date. It also comes just two days after closing arguments in a U.S. federal government suit against Qualcomm which claimed the chip maker\u2019s patent-royalty practice helped it to stifle competition. Germany is Western Europe\u2019s second-largest smartphone market, behind the U.K., and Europe accounted for nearly a quarter of Apple\u2019s total sales in fiscal 2018. In December, the same court found that Apple had infringed on one of Qualcomm\u2019s hardware patents, and issued an injunction against the sale of some older iPhone models. That decision came shortly after a Chinese court issued a similar sales ban on some iPhones. Apple said at the time that it would appeal the decisions and would remove affected iPhones from its stores in Germany, though it would continue to sell in China during the appeal process. Earlier this month, another German regional court in Mannheim dismissed one of two patent suits brought by Qualcomm. The second decision is expected next month. The various legal disputes could help determine how much revenue Apple must share with Qualcomm from its most important product, while global smartphone sales are slowing. Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf said Wednesday the company is pursuing enforcement of its injunctions and believes the earlier rulings in its favor in Munich and China will be upheld on appeal.",

        "content": "There is one thing that both Apple bulls and bears can agree on after examining its latest earnings report: the tech power has a lot more work to do. Apple reported quarterly financial results Tuesday night after the market\u2019s close, and its stock rose Wednesday. Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) closed up nearly 7% to just over $165, putting the shares up almost 5% in 2019. As Barron\u2019s reported, the company\u2019s earnings were somewhat better than Wall Street expected\u2014as was its outlook for the current quarter. Barron\u2019s scanned Wall Street analysts\u2019 reports Wednesday morning to get a sense of their sentiment. The snippets below are arranged, generally, from most to least bullish. \u2022 J.P. Morgan\u2019s Samik Chatterjee, who has an Overweight rating and a $228 price target on the stock, said the company\u2019s services margin \u201cis likely to drive upside to investor expectations for [the] intrinsic value of Apple shares.\u201d Why he thinks so: A \u201chigher portion of the company\u2019s profits coming from Services, which investors assign a higher multiple to relative to the hardware-centric businesses; and [increased] investor confidence in assigning a premium valuation to the Services opportunity relative to hardware businesses.\u201d \u2022 At Wedbush, Dan Ives has an Outperform rating and a $200 price target on the stock. \u201cThere is clearly an Everest-like climb ahead for Apple to turn around its China doldrums in the near-term,\u201d Ives wrote. \u201cAlthough with roughly 20% of all iPhone upgrades over the next 12 to 18 months out of this region, Cupertino still has a clear window of opportunity to change the tide with the right pricing strategy (e.g., lower XR price tags) and trifecta of iPhones slated to hit the market in September 2019.\u201d \u2022 FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his Outperform rating and $190 price target, but he\u2019s troubled by Apple\u2019s business in China, which plunged 27% year-over-year, to $13.2 billion, and iPhone sales, down 15% to $52 billion. He is heartened, however, by Services revenue, which grew 19% to a record $10.9 billion for the quarter. By the end of 2018, Apple had 360 million paid subscribers, and it is expected to hit 500 million in 2020, CFO Luca Maestri said Tuesday. Seyrafi is also bullish about wearables, home devices and accessories sales, which surged 33% year-over-year and accounted for nearly 9% of revenue. \u2022 UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri has a Buy rating on Apple stock. He boosted his share price target by $5 to $185, saying the worst may be over for now. \u201cVideo in particular does not seem like a zero-sum-game with room for Apple to coexist,\u201d Arcuri wrote. \u201cWhile there are existing players in these content markets, Apple can marry new content with distribution.\u201d \u2022 At Citi, Jim Suva reiterated a Buy rating and a $170 price target. \u201cYes, the focus by Apple on services may help its valuation over time,\u201d Suva wrote. \u201cBut we note even if Apple services were to grow over 50% the next few years it would still represent less than 25% of the company\u2019s total sales. So the near-term debate is the investor set up and expectations.\u201d \u2022 Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal has a Neutral rating and a $170 price target on the stock, the latter which he lowered by $5 while cutting his estimates for 2019 and 2020 earnings per share to slightly below consensus. \u201cWe believe iPhone volumes are on a sustainably lower trajectory than expected even after the preannouncement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cServices growth, however, seems to have stabilized at a healthy, if lower, 20% rate. \u2022 KeyBanc Capital Markets\u2019 Andy Hargreaves has a Sector Weight rating on Apple stock. He pegs its fair value as $161 per share. \u201cHardware sales appear likely to continue declining, while Services appears likely to decelerate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis leaves little to drive multiple expansion.\u201d \u2022 Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers has a Market Perform rating and a $160 price target on Apple\u2019s shares. \u201cWhile we consider Apple\u2019s incremental installed base and services disclosures / expansion to be a positive, we...think Apple\u2019s challenges in China will persist,\u201d Rakers wrote. \u2022 HSBC\u2019s Erwan Rambourg reiterated a Hold rating and a $160 price target. \u201dApple does not look particularly expensive here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut current trading, especially in emerging markets, looks bound to continue being tough.\u201d \u2022 Another analyst with a $160 price target: Jefferies\u2019 Timothy O\u2019Shea, who has a Hold rating on the shares. \u201cWearables looks like a long-term growth opportunity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAirPods and Watch look like the real deal, and we expect Apple will enter more categories over time.\u201d \u2022 BMO Capital Markets\u2019 Tim Long, who has a Market Perform rating and a $153 price target on the stock, lowered his 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates to below-Street consensus estimates. \u201cWe see no catalyst on the horizon,\u201d Long wrote. \u2022 Macquarie Research analyst Benjamin Schachter has a Neutral rating on the shares, as well as a fair value estimate of $149. The \u201ciPhone is still the biggest issue,\u201d Schachter wrote. \u201cManagement highlighted a few reasonable reasons for weakness (China, longer upgrade cycle, foreign exchange effects, subsidies, battery replacement program), but we worry that limited innovation is also a meaningful factor.\u201d \u2022 At Raymond James, Chris Caso reiterated a Market Perform rating on the stock. \u201cSentiment on the stock is now solidly negative, which should help it find a bottom, and we do think the stock will eventually be buyable into a 2020 5G cycle,\u201d Caso wrote. \u201cBut in order for the stock to bottom, we wish to see consensus capitulate not just on this year\u2019s cycle, but also on next year\u2019s cycle.\u201d \u2022 And at Oppenheimer, analyst Andrew Uerkwitz reiterated a Perform rating. \u201cAs long as iPhone sales do not grow, we believe the stock will struggle to work,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLonger term, we see tremendous value in the Apple ecosystem and its ability to monetize its user base. Apple\u2019s substantial capital return program should provide downside protection.\u201d Jon Swartz contributed to this story. This story was first published on Jan. 30, 2019.

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s largest iPhone assembler, Foxconn Technology Group, is considering producing the devices in India, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could reduce Apple\u2019s dependence on China for manufacturing and potentially for sales. Executives at Foxconn, a contract manufacturer that assembles a large portion of the world\u2019s iPhones in China, are studying whether to include an India project in budget plans, one of the people said. Senior executives, possibly including Chairman Terry Gou, plan to visit India after next month\u2019s Lunar New Year to discuss plans, the people familiar said. Foxconn\u2019s look at India comes as sustained friction between Washington and Beijing over trade and technology is pushing many companies to consider diversifying their supply chains away from China, a global center of assembly for smartphones, computers and other electronics. Apple currently manufactures most of its iPhones in China through Foxconn, a Taiwan-based company formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317 -0.33% , as well as via other contract manufacturers. That business model, along with a sizable reliance on sales in China, has made Apple vulnerable to rising U.S.-China tensions over trade and geopolitical rivalry. Foxconn said in a statement it doesn\u2019t comment on current or potential customers or any of their products. An Apple spokesman in India declined to comment. As difficulties in the China market grow, India is attracting the world\u2019s tech companies, both for its potential as a manufacturing base and for its huge emerging market of 1.3 billion consumers. Only about a quarter of Indian consumers own smartphones, according to research company eMarketer. Apple has struggled to crack the Indian market, with its already small market share dropping last year to about 1% from about 2% in 2017. Apple has so far built mostly lower-end models in India. Wistron Corp. , another Taiwanese contract manufacturer, began assembling the SE model, then Apple\u2019s cheapest, in the southern state of Karnataka in 2017. Those were the first iPhones made in India, and Wistron has since started assembling the 6S model there as well. Foxconn is currently considering producing higher end, pricier iPhones in India, including models with organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays, the people familiar said. The relatively high price of iPhones compared with those of other brands has hampered Apple in the Indian market, analysts say. Manufacturing its high-end iPhones in India could help lower prices by allowing Apple to avoid a tariff that adds 20% to devices imported from China. An expanding business in India could also offer Apple a potentially huge alternative to China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market. Apple is grappling with weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones. Lackluster China sales of iPhones in part contributed to Mr. Cook this month announcing Apple\u2019s first cut in revenue guidance since he took the helm in 2011. Foxconn has facilities in India and produces devices there for companies such as Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. While it has produced iPhones elsewhere, including Brazil, Foxconn currently relies on China to produce the devices on a large scale. Indian media reported late last year that Foxconn would begin production of various models of the iPhone in the country. In looking to expand production beyond China, Foxconn has been studying Vietnam as well as India, the people familiar said. It is leaning toward India because of the market\u2019s growth potential, these people said. On the negative side, the people said, Indian workers aren\u2019t as skilled in precision manufacturing as their Chinese counterparts and India\u2019s infrastructure lags behind China\u2019s. In addition, they said, India will have to do more to develop its smartphone supply chain to compete with China, where Beijing and local governments have worked to move factories up the value chain.",

        "content": "BERLIN\u2014A German court dismissed a patent lawsuit from Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% against Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% the first setback in the country for the chip maker in a dispute that resulted last month in the ban of some iPhone sales in China and Germany. The regional court in the city of Mannheim said Tuesday that a patent-infringement case brought by Qualcomm was unfounded, though the chip maker can appeal the decision. The ruling is the first of six patent cases brought by Qualcomm in Mannheim, with the second such decision expected next month, a spokesman for the court said. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether or how Tuesday\u2019s decision would affect other patent cases brought by Qualcomm. The decision is the first win for Apple in a series of global patent disputes launched against it by Qualcomm, following rulings last month in Munich and Fuzhou, China, that ordered Apple to stop selling some older iPhone models in their respective jurisdictions. Apple said at the time that it would appeal both decisions. The company also said it would remove affected iPhone models from its stores in Germany during the process, though its full portfolio of smartphones would remain on sale in China. The newest iPhone models\u2014including the XS, XS Max, and XR\u2014weren\u2019t affected by those rulings. In Tuesday\u2019s ruling the court determined that Apple hadn\u2019t infringed on Qualcomm\u2019s patent by installing the company\u2019s chips in its iPhones. \u201cThe Mannheim court interpreted one aspect of our patent very narrowly, saying that because a voltage inside a part of an iPhone wasn\u2019t constant, the patent wasn\u2019t infringed. We strongly disagree and will appeal,\u201d Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel for Qualcomm, said in a statement. He added that \u201cApple has a history of infringing our patents,\u201d citing last month\u2019s rulings in Germany and China. \u201cWe are happy with the decision and thank the court for their time and diligence,\u201d a spokesman for Apple said. \u201cWe regret Qualcomm\u2019s use of the court to divert attention from their illegal behavior that is the subject of multiple lawsuits and proceedings around the world.\u201d The continuing legal disputes date to a suit Apple launched in January 2017 against Qualcomm and have expanded to several patent disputes in the U.S., China and Germany. Qualcomm is also facing a continuing antitrust lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",

        "content": "When Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said China\u2019s slowing economy contributed to its late-year sales slump, the news rattled the stocks of other major U.S. companies with big operations in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Now, as U.S. companies prepare to report their quarterly earnings, China\u2019s impact will be revealed. The amount of damage is likely to depend on such factors as who the company\u2019s customers are and how much competition it faces in China. Take Starbucks Corp. SBUX 0.64% and Nike Inc. NKE 0.18% The coffee chain, which faces relatively stiff competition in China, has warned of slow growth in the country, while the sneaker maker, which doesn\u2019t, just reported big gains there. Some companies that are heavily exposed to the country, like chip maker Texas Instruments Inc., TXN 1.94% may prove less vulnerable because their customers are primarily Chinese manufacturers rather than consumers. Conversely, companies don\u2019t have to sell directly to China to take a hit\u2014makers of watches and other luxury products, for instance, rely on spending by Chinese tourists in Europe, Japan and the U.S. China\u2019s manufacturing sector has declined since late 2017 because of lower private-sector investment, and in the fourth quarter revenue growth slowed or stagnated in every sector, according to China Beige Book, which collects and analyzes data on China\u2019s economy. Last year\u2019s growth likely got a boost from a rush of orders by companies seeking to dodge new tariffs imposed as part of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Retail sales growth slowed in November to the lowest level in 15 years, and Chinese consumers have begun putting off major purchases, recent data showed. \u201cNow we\u2019re entering a worse time,\u201d said Leland Miller, chief executive of research firm China Beige Book International. \u201cThe slowing economy and headwind from the trade war have created a much gloomier environment.\u201d U.S. companies competing in China\u2019s consumer markets tend to target wealthier customers, where the slowdown is more pronounced, said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who was deputy assistant Treasury secretary for international economic analysis in the Obama administration. \u201cI certainly expect other companies that sell to the top end of the Chinese consumer market to be under a bit of pressure,\u201d Mr. Setser said. \u201cEvery indicator in China has been below expectation.\u201d More than a third of S&P 500 revenue is generated outside the U.S.\u2014and about 10% comes from developing economies, of which China makes up a big part, economists say. China looms larger for some companies. Of the 25 companies in the S&P 500 that disclosed China-specific sales for the September quarter, eight of them said the country contributed at least 20% of revenues. Apple reported about 20% of its sales came from China in its most recent fiscal year, ended Sept. 29, while Nike sold $1.5 billion of goods in the country in the quarter ended Nov. 30, or about $1 in every $6 of its total revenue. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has said he believes the slowdown was sharpened by trade tensions between China and the U.S. but that he is now optimistic about the two countries reaching an agreement that will benefit both economies. Many of the companies disclosing the biggest reliance on China revenue are manufacturers, where sheer volume may prove a poor measure of vulnerability. Component makers, for example, could sell primarily to Chinese manufacturers, which then sell finished products around the globe, not just to Chinese consumers. Chip maker Texas Instruments said in its latest annual report that many of its exports fall into that category. The company reported nearly half of its third-quarter sales from China. It didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. U.S. brands like Victoria\u2019s Secret owner L Brands Inc. and Tapestry Inc., which sells Coach and Kate Spade handbags, have been expecting slower growth in China, said Cowen retail analyst Oliver Chen. \u201cIt\u2019s a tougher environment for hard luxury,\u201d Mr. Chen said. L Brands and Tapestry declined to comment. Starbucks, which is going up against rapidly growing domestic coffee chains, has warned that comparable sales will likely grow at its more than 3,600 stores across China by 1% to 3% this year. That is at the low end of recent years, and slower than U.S. growth forecasts. Starbucks officials say its China stores are profitable and the company is focused on adding locations in the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve always played the long game in China,\u201d a company spokesman said. Nike reported strong sales growth in China last year, rising 31% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, excluding currency-conversion effects. \u201cWe continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion told analysts in a December conference call. One likely factor: Its shoes, while priced at a premium, are still cheaper than iPhones, and appear to be faring better against the kind of domestic competition that Starbucks faces, said John Zolidis, a consumer-sector analyst with Quo Vadis Capital. That, along with the company\u2019s marketing, may shelter Nike from belt-tightening by Chinese consumers. In the end, companies coming off strong 2018 results and facing slower growth around the globe have an incentive to be cautious in discussing upcoming results, said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, a unit of French bank Groupe BPCE. \u201cMy guess is, what Apple did will be the blueprint for many other companies,\u201d Mr. LaVorgna said. \u201cCaution is going to pervade the landscape.\u201d",

        "content": "The iPhone is arguably the most valuable product in the world, representing the backbone of Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s half-trillion-dollar hardware business and undergirding its software-peddling App store. It remains the envy of consumer-product companies world-wide. If history is any indication, though, America\u2019s favorite handheld device will someday take up residence with the digital camera, the calculator, the pager, Sony\u2019s Walkman and the Palm Pilot in a museum. Although it\u2019s hard to imagine the iPhone dying, change can sneak up rapidly on contraptions that are deeply entrenched in American culture. Consider it was as recently as the mid-1990s when I spent an hour a day during my senior year in high school in a room full of electric typewriters learning to type. Today, I spend most of my working hours using that skill to bang away on a keyboard, but I have rarely touched an actual typewriter in 25 years. \u201cOver time, every franchise dies,\u201d said Nick Santhanam, McKinsey\u2019s Americas practice leader in Silicon Valley. \u201cYou can innovate on an amazing mousetrap, but if people eventually don\u2019t want a mousetrap, you\u2019re screwed.\u201d Kodak, Polaroid and Sears are all examples from the recent past of companies that held too tightly to an old idea. Today\u2019s tech giants, ranging from Netflix (having already reinvented itself to be dependent on advertising-free streaming video) to Google parent Alphabet Inc. (counting advertising as 86% of revenue), should take note of those painful demises to avoid the same fate. Apple\u2019s mousetrap is anything but broken. Representing 60% of Apple\u2019s revenue, the iPhone outsells 96% of the companies on the Fortune 500. The phone carries the bulk of the $545 billion valuation that Morgan Stanley assigns to Apple\u2019s wider hardware business. Apple, for the better part of the 2000s, was the master of the next big thing: the iPod, the MacBook Air, the iPad, the iPhone. Apple wasn\u2019t always first, but its products were easier to use, thinner, cooler. With the success of the iPhone since it arrived on the scene, the next big thing has been harder to find. Apple has had no breakthrough on TV, a modest success with its watch, a stumble in music and a lot of speculation concerning its intentions for autonomous cars or creating original programming. Now, as in a comic-book movie, we\u2019re all left to wonder whether Apple\u2019s greatest strength could be its biggest weakness? Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook acknowledges the latest iPhone delivery trends indicate his company faces a potential inflection point. \u201cApple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a Jan. 2 letter to investors. Apple has a legacy of invention, Mr. Cook says. That\u2019s something the Cupertino, Calif., company is eventually going to need. In a CNBC interview Tuesday, he pointed to rapid growth in services and \u201cwearables\u201d\u2014such as watches or ear buds\u2014as reason for optimism. Someday, Apple will be known more for its contribution to health care than its sleek gadgets, Mr. Cook says. Whatever shape it takes, Apple\u2019s evolution will be closely watched if only because reinvention is so hard to pull off. A decade ago, Nokia\u2019s dominance in handheld devices evaporated after executives failed to create a compelling operating system to make their pricey smartphones more user-friendly. Finnish executives have told me on several occasions that Nokia knew it needed to rapidly change, but lacked the urgency and resources to do it. There are success stories, to be sure. The Model T almost entirely underpinned Ford Motor Co.\u2019s rise a century ago, when the Detroit auto maker owned roughly half of the U.S. car market. Without \u201cThe Universal Car,\u201d Henry Ford likely would have been forgotten. A closer parallel to Apple is Microsoft Corp. Its best-known product, Windows, was so dominant that it drew extreme regulatory scrutiny while vaulting the Seattle software company atop the personal-computer market before cloud computing existed. \u201c \u201cYou can innovate on an amazing mousetrap, but if people eventually don\u2019t want a mousetrap, you\u2019re screwed.\u201d \u201d Both Ford and Microsoft adapted and survived. Iconic vehicles like Ford\u2019s Mustang coupe or F-150 pickup prove companies can live a productive life after the initial hit product fades. Microsoft\u2019s transition to cloud computing with its Azure product, meanwhile, has vaulted the company back near the top of the race for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. Still, it\u2019s a slog. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a two-trick pony,\u201d former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer told me Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to do one. It\u2019s super amazing to do two. Doing three? I have a lot of respect for a company that can do three tricks. \u2026 It\u2019s just hard to come up with concepts that can make that happen.\u201d He said Apple\u2019s line of Mac products is one trick and the so-called i-Series (iPhone or iPod) was a second. \u201cIf they had stopped with the iPod, where would they be?\u201d They succeeded because \u201cthey pushed beyond\u201d with a phone. By all accounts, the iPhone\u2019s run\u2014nearing the dozen-year mark\u2014has been remarkable, especially when you consider the average company in the S&P 500 remains in the index for only 15 years. Mr. Cook\u2019s legacy, however, hinges on how well he pulls off Apple\u2019s next act.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% has held out its fast-growing services unit as a bright spot in an outlook dimmed by soft demand for the iPhone. But the services business faces challenges of its own. Chief Executive Tim Cook last week underscored that business\u2019s importance in his investor letter warning of slowing iPhone sales, singling out $10.8 billion in services sales for the quarter ended in December. It was the only revenue the company disclosed from its five business segments and another spotlight on a fast-growing business that includes App Store sales, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments. But Apple still relies on the iPhone for two-thirds of sales, and growth in services are threatened by a recent slowdown in App Store sales, nascent antitrust concerns and services like Netflix Inc. moving to avoid Apple\u2019s payment system. Apple also hasn\u2019t shown a willingness to make its services vastly available beyond its devices, nor proven it can keep pace with tech rivals like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google that constantly modify software and tap a trove of personal data to customize products. It is the tech-company equivalent of asking a tiger to change its stripes, said Ben Bajarin, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cGrowing the services business is going to take a very different playbook,\u201d he said. The tech landscape is dotted with hardware companies that have turned to services for growth. For companies like International Business Machines Corp. , Hewlett Packard and Dell Technologies Inc., the transition came as they faced slowdowns in their core business and wasn\u2019t always smooth. Those companies pushed into business services. Apple is focused on consumers, whose tastes can change rapidly. Its success hinges on driving sales of apps and new offerings like video content and news subscriptions. Services have become Apple\u2019s fastest-growing segment. In 2017, Mr. Cook set a goal of doubling the business to $50 billion by 2020, a feat Apple is on track for after revenue rose 33% last fiscal year to $39.75 billion. The business accounts for 15% of total sales, up from 11% in fiscal 2016. Apple last week reclassified its quarterly results for last fiscal year because of new accounting standards, shifting some product revenue to its services business. But Apple\u2019s services are tied to the amount of iPhones, iPads and Macs in people\u2019s hands\u2014and growth in those devices has begun to slow. Apple said total active devices increased 8% last year to 1.4 billion, a deceleration from the more than 15% compounded annual growth rate between 2015 and 2018. The slowdown is pronounced in China, where iPhone demand has waned because of a weakening economy, rising smartphone competition and increasing popularity of WeChat, an all-in-one app from Tencent Holdings Ltd. for messaging, payments and more. WeChat lives on top of Apple\u2019s iOS software, reducing iOS\u2019 differences from Android. It also offers apps that lessen the App Store\u2019s appeal. In China, App Store sales rose 14% last year, shrinking from more than 120% compounded annual growth rate between 2012 and 2018, according to Sensor Tower, which tracks app spending. Still, Mr. Cook said services revenue in China hit a record during the December period. \u201cWe believe our business in China has a bright future,\u201d he said in his letter to investors. Outside of China, Apple continues to enjoy strong device loyalty with an estimated 90% retention rate of existing iPhone owners, said Horace Dediu, an analyst at Asymco and former Nokia Corp. executive. The number of people paying for services remains a small percentage of the 1.4 billion active devices and stands to grow in the years ahead, he said. Apple has a mixed history in services. While iTunes and the App Store have been hits, Maps was initially plagued by inaccuracies and Apple Pay struggled to gain traction. The App Store\u2019s success has overshadowed shortcomings. It is the largest contributor to services with about 35% of sales, according to investment bank Jefferies LLC. Apple, which takes 30% of store sales, has more than tripled store revenue since 2014 to $44.49 billion, according to Sensor Tower. The App Store\u2019s momentum, though, may be slowing. Aside from China, sales growth in the U.S. fell slightly last year, according to Sensor Tower. \u201cYou\u2019ve tapped those markets out, and the spending power of the typical smartphone user in growing markets like India is nowhere near the U.S.,\u201d said Randy Nelson, Sensor Tower\u2019s head of mobile insights. Meanwhile, Apple awaits a Supreme Court decision in a case that determines if iPhone owners can sue Apple for antitrust damages for its alleged monopoly on the App Store. Should the justices decide the case has merit, Apple would face a challenge to its 30% cut of App Store sales. Netflix and Fortnite creator Epic Games Inc. already are trying to avoid sharing revenue with Apple. Netflix plans to stop using Apple\u2019s billing system for new customers. Epic Games is setting up its own app store, taking only a 12% cut of sales. Licensing revenue\u2014the largest driver of revenue growth last year\u2014also is expected to slow. Google pays Apple up to an estimated $9 billion to be the default search engine on Safari internet browsers, but Google expects such acquisition costs to moderate after jumping last year. In the face of those challenges, Apple is broadening the reach of Apple Music and iTunes movies. Apple Music is now available on speakers powered by Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and an iTunes movies and TV shows app will be available this year on new Samsung televisions while new LG and Sony TVs will be able to stream video from Apple devices. The deals show Apple is open to valuing music and video subscriptions over HomePod speaker and Apple TV sales, said Mr. Bajarin. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee everyone is on iPhones,\u201d he said. Analysts speculate Apple could offer a single subscription to multiple services like video, news and music. \u201cAn all-you-can-eat option...would be a no-brainer proposition for\u201d some Apple customers, said Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.",

        "content": "Wireless carriers have long made smartphones look cheaper to consumers by subsidizing their cost. Now Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is trying to woo phone buyers, offsetting the price of devices with generous trade-in offers. The company has rolled out at least one new iPhone in each of the last several years, adding features that have pushed the starting price of its top-of-line model above $1,000. With less fanfare, Apple has also let U.S. customers trade in older models for credit\u2014a program it is now hoping will help mitigate the sticker shock. Apple, which rarely discounts its products, has recently used the trade-in program to incentivize purchases, sweetening offers late last year with an additional $100 credit. The company also has been more aggressive in its marketing of the program, promoting the iPhone XR on its website and in emails to customers at a price of $449 with trade-in of an older phone rather than at its starting retail price of $749. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said last week that making it easier for iPhone customers to trade in their phones directly with the technology giant and more easily transfer their data to new devices were part of its efforts sell more smartphones after slower sales in China and elsewhere led to a rare cut to the company\u2019s quarterly revenue forecast. Apple often gives consumers more for their old iPhones than the four major U.S. wireless carriers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of estimated monthly trade-in value data from HYLA Mobile Inc., particularly older models. Hyla works with telecom companies and big-box stores on such programs. With the iPhone 6, for example, Apple has offered a higher trade-in value than Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. in most months between September 2015 and the end of 2018, the most recent Hyla data show. For the iPhone SE, Apple has offered a higher trade-in value than all four major carriers each month since October 2016. Offers fluctuate by model and storage space. To date, however, that trade-in pricing edge hasn\u2019t been large or well-enough known to consumers to stop an iPhone sales slowdown. Trade-in programs face some headwinds from customers who aren\u2019t swayed by the discount, pass along old devices to other family members or see upgrades as a hassle when their phone continues to function well. Beth Cole, a real-estate agent in Palm Beach, Fla., upgraded her iPhone 5s to an iPhone 8 Plus late last year. Ms. Cole said she had problems transferring all of her contacts to the new phone and spent several hours at Verizon and Apple stores to resolve the issue. \u201cI\u2019m going to have this 8 Plus until I die,\u201d she said. Device makers like Apple have been hurt in recent years by changes to the structure of wireless phone contracts. Carriers have offered less-generous promotions and separated the cost of a phone from a customer\u2019s monthly service fees, leading to the demise of the two-year ritual of upgrading devices and service contracts simultaneously. That change has made it easier for carriers to hold onto customers, but tougher for device makers because many consumers would rather stick with their old phones and enjoy lower monthly expenses once their devices are paid off. Apple customers keep their iPhones even longer than other smartphone owners, according to Hyla. While consumers waited an average of 2.83 years to upgrade in the third quarter, iPhones traded in during the period were an average of 2.92 years old. Apple\u2019s trade-in and recycling program began as an online-only option in 2011 and has since evolved into what is now called Apple GiveBack in stores or on the web. It now offers trade-in credit for Apple\u2019s own products and rival devices in addition to the recycling option for phones not eligible for credit. \u201cWhy not put it toward a new iPhone?,\u201d an online message says after spitting out an estimated trade-in value for a rival device based on responses to questions about its make and quality. Attractive trade-in offers give phone sellers a boost beyond the device sale. Winning a purchase from a customer looking to trade in a phone means Apple sits at the center of the consumer relationship, rather than a carrier, getting an advantage on sales of accessories and insurance. That can keep customers from going to their carrier\u2019s retail store, where sales associates have an opportunity to re-up their contracts. Still, the majority of new devices\u2014about three-quarters\u2014are currently bought through carriers, said Biju Nair, chief executive of Hyla. He estimates that 62% of every trade-in dollar is spent in store on either devices, chargers, cases or other accessories and services. Bill Hampton, 72, upgraded from an iPhone SE to an iPhone X through his employer in December and said that while he enjoys the new phone\u2019s faster performance and better speakers, he kept his old device because the trade-in value on offer was limited. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on my shelf in a growing collection of old iPhones,\u201d said Mr. Hampton, the editor in chief of newsletter AutoBeat Daily. \u201cI\u2019m oblivious to all these offers.\u201d \u2014Tripp Mickle contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s profit margins have long been the envy of the consumer-electronics world. Defending those margins may now be coming at a significant cost to what is no longer the world\u2019s most valuable company. Slowing iPhone sales triggered a nearly unprecedented warning from Apple on Wednesday about lower-than-expected revenue for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 29. That warning\u2014the first from the company in nearly 17 years\u2014sliced another 10% off Apple\u2019s already battered shares on Thursday and brought the total damage over the last two months to 37%, or about $415 billion in market value. That makes the one-time trillion dollar company now only the fourth most valuable in tech behind Microsoft, Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Apple cited disappointing sales of the iPhone, mostly in China, as the main reason for its reduced outlook. That comes as Apple has continued to raise prices on its iPhones to help offset a slowdown in unit sales reflective of a maturing global smartphone market. Apple now has five iPhone configurations priced at more than $1,000 in the U.S. In China, the cheapest of the company\u2019s newest models, the iPhone XR, costs nearly twice as much as a comparable device from Huawei without any trade-in credits. That pricing game now seems played out, which raises the question of just how Apple can maintain the profit margins that have long been a major point of attraction for investors. Apple\u2019s gross margin has averaged 39% over the last five fiscal years and analysts estimate the iPhone lineup alone averages gross margins closer to 50%. Apple\u2019s operating margins, which take into account marketing, R&D and other costs to run the business, totaled 27% for the fiscal year ended September, compared with about 10% for the mobile-phone division of rival Samsung over the same time frame. Apple has never been a low-price leader, nor has it ever chased market share for the sake of share. But the product that generates more than two-thirds of its revenue is now in a mature global market with little-to-no growth seen for the years ahead. Consumers also no longer feel the need to rush out and buy the latest and greatest device, particularly when it costs them $1,000 or more. And while Apple and its supporters still frequently point to the growing services business as an important offset, most of Apple\u2019s services remain closely tied to its devices. Even with strong projected growth ahead, analysts expect services to account for less than one-quarter of the company\u2019s revenue by 2021. Cutting iPhone prices would likely hurt Apple\u2019s margins and may feel like a bitter pill for investors to swallow. But Apple is now trading just under 10 times forward earnings, excluding its huge pile of nearly $123 billion in net cash, which makes it the cheapest among large-cap techs, save for IBM. Once dominant Big Blue also used to covet earnings protection. That should serve as a sharp reminder for Apple and its investors that things can always get worse\u2014if they let it.",

        "content": "BEIJING\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% brought the high-end smartphone to China. Now it is sputtering as homegrown rivals win over consumers by offering similar designs and features at far lower prices. While Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, blamed China\u2019s economic slowdown for weakening sales that hurt its global revenue in the past quarter, the company\u2019s problems run deeper than that. The Cupertino, Calif., tech giant may have underestimated how competitive domestic smartphone makers have become, analysts say. Once a top-seller in China, Apple has slipped to the fifth-biggest phone seller in that country, trailing four domestic producers that have all been growing in popularity. Despite developing more features targeted at Chinese consumers, Apple\u2019s market share has stagnated. Chinese rivals including Huawei Technologies Co. and Oppo and Vivo, which are owned by BBK Electronics Corp., have rolled out popular features such as camera functions designed for users to take better selfies. China smartphone market share 19% Huawei 25% 18 Oppo 21 16 Vivo 20 11 Xiaomi 8 14 Apple 8 28 Others 12 2017 2018 Note: Data through September Source: Canalys \u201cThe others are a little closer to the pulse of what matters to Chinese consumers,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director at Marbridge Consulting in Beijing. Moreover, Apple\u2019s iOS operating system is proving less \u201csticky\u201d for Chinese consumers than in other markets because smartphone users spend a large chunk of their phone time inside WeChat , a chat, payments and social-media app from Tencent Holdings Ltd. Chinese consumers who won\u2019t pay for the status of brandishing the top-priced iPhone model are considered more fickle when it comes to brands, said Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based analyst at market-research firm Canalys. As the economic slowdown pushes consumers to tighten their purse strings, such consumers are generally more inclined to consider cheaper, non-Apple smartphones, Mr. Jia said. Apple on Wednesday slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years. In a letter to investors, Mr. Cook said the revenue shortfall stemmed from lower-than-anticipated iPhone sales in Greater China. The worse-than-expected performance in China adds to pressure on Isabel Ge Mahe, who was appointed in 2017 to oversee the crucial market that accounts for almost 20% of Apple\u2019s global sales. Apple posted sales growth in the Greater China region for five consecutive quarters until the quarter that ended Sept. 29. Overall smartphone shipment volume in China has been falling for seven consecutive quarters, data from Canalys show. For Apple, its volume for the nine months to the end of September declined 11.8% from the previous year, even as its market share grew 0.2 percentage point to 7.8%. Apple\u2019s current struggle in China is illustrated by the iPhone XR, one of the three handsets that Apple released last year. Apple had placed big orders for the iPhone XR to be sold in China before it went on sale last October, anticipating strong demand, a person familiar with the matter said. Now it is grappling with excess inventory, the person said. The XR\u2014the lowest priced among the three latest models\u2014starts at a still-hefty 6,499 yuan ($945). By comparison, one competing Huawei model, Mate 20, which was also launched last year with the latest chipsets, starts at 3,999 yuan. Sales of Apple\u2019s more extravagant handset, the iPhone XS Max, with a starting price of 9,599 yuan ($1,400), have been more resilient, according to Mr. Jia of Canalys. Global smartphone sales have fallen over the past year, reflecting sticker shock over new phone prices and a lack of show-stopping features to persuade consumers to upgrade. Global shipments fell 7% for the three months ended Sept. 30 versus the prior year, the fourth straight quarter of declines, according to Canalys, a market research firm. Meanwhile, China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market, tumbled even more at 15%, Canalys said. Apple has taken steps to court Chinese customers\u2014its latest models introduced a dual-SIM support feature popular with the country\u2019s phone users, though most Chinese rivals had already offered that. In the past, Apple has also enabled iPhone owners to use their phone number as Apple ID as many people don\u2019t frequently use email, and offered the iPhone in rose gold color. In an effort to boost sales, Apple in recent weeks started to offer discounts in China for trade-ins with used phones, according to its website. Mr. Cook also cited China\u2019s rising trade tensions with the U.S. as a factor affecting China\u2019s economy. The company hasn\u2019t faced significant anti-Apple sentiment; indirectly, some three million people work in China at suppliers as well as outlets that sell Apple goods, Apple has said. Still, pockets of resistance have emerged. Following the arrest in Canada last month of the Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou at the behest of U.S. prosecutors investigating sanctions violations, some Chinese companies have openly encouraged their employees to purchase Huawei phones. Apple has also received some cancellations from Chinese companies for iPhone orders, which are sometimes given out as year-end bonuses, though they haven\u2019t had a major impact on Apple\u2019s business, a person familiar with the matter said. \u2014Timothy W.

        "content": "Apple\u2019s AAPL 0.85% woes in China, which have caused the company to cut its quarterly sales forecast for the first time in 15 years, may have come as a shock. In truth, we should have seen it coming. That isn\u2019t because investors ought to have identified Apple as a potential victim of the U.S.-China trade fight. There may be some Chinese consumers who have spurned its phones for patriotic reasons in recent months, but the evidence for a widespread Apple boycott is thin. The simpler and more convincing reason for the sales slump is that China\u2019s economy is weakening, creating a poor backdrop for Apple to sell its pricey phones into an already saturated market. Smartphone shipments in China have been falling for six straight quarters, according to data firm IDC. As Chinese consumer confidence weakens, it\u2019s natural that they would turn away from expensive iPhones and toward cheaper models. Apple\u2019s smartphones sell for an average of nearly $900 in China, whereas those from local rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi sell for less than $300 each. These companies have been chipping away Apple\u2019s market share. Apple was able to paper over some of the cracks in late 2017, when it jacked up smartphone sales prices by more than 20%, on average. That, in turn, helped it enjoy its best-ever quarter for revenue in mainland China. But with consumers now more sensitive about prices, a similar increase wasn\u2019t likely to be as successful as last autumn\u2019s was. Chinese consumers\u2019 purchases of other big-ticket items\u2014like cars or refrigerators\u2014have also fallen off a cliff recently. And last year\u2019s new lineup of iPhones didn\u2019t include any killer features that would normally compel consumers to upgrade. Apple\u2019s Chinese customers aren\u2019t as loyal as those in the U.S. to begin with. Only about 60% of existing Chinese iPhone owners would consider sticking with the American brand for their next smartphone, according to a report from research firm Aurora Mobile. Similar surveys in the U.S. show that close to 90% of users there will likely stay with iPhones. That\u2019s due in part to the overwhelming popularity of WeChat in China: The messaging app acts as a mini-operating system, meaning it\u2019s less painful for users to consider switching from Apple\u2019s iOS-based phones to models powered by Android. Absent better news on the macroeconomic front, Apple\u2019s problems in China risk becoming a permanent feature.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% sought this week to avoid a ban on the sale of older iPhones in China by releasing a software update that some intellectual property lawyers said could enable the company to keep selling those products in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market. The move by Apple came in response to a preliminary injunction from a Chinese court that ordered the company to stop selling certain iPhones while it studies Apple\u2019s possible infringement of two software patents held by chip maker Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% The two American giants in the smartphone industry are locked in a bruising legal battle over technology licensing. Despite the late November injunction, Apple continued to sell the older iPhones, saying it was in compliance, and subsequently filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its decision. Apple hasn\u2019t explained why it considers itself in compliance. The sales ban is a provisional measure while the court considers a final verdict on Qualcomm\u2019s patent-infringement suit. Many lawyers who studied the court\u2019s decision believe Apple initially defied the ban, challenging China\u2019s judicial authority. The lawyers warned that could hurt the company\u2019s business standing and brand reputation in a market that accounts for a fifth of Apple\u2019s total sales. Qualcomm said Apple was playing down the preliminary injunction and flouting the legal system. It has asked the court to force Apple to comply with the ban. Apple says its software update on Monday addressed the patents in question. The new version of iOS 12 changes how an app disappears from an iPhone display when a user swipes the screen upward\u2014one of the features contested by the two U.S. companies. Apple mentioned the new feature in notes explaining the update on phones using a Chinese-language setting, though not in an English-language setting. The changes could bring Apple into compliance with the court and ease pressure on the company, some lawyers said. Douglas Clark, an attorney based in Hong Kong, said such software updates are commonly used in instances of high-tech patent infringements. It could be effective in this case because the preliminary injunction only blocks Apple from selling phones that violate the patents\u2014not all iPhones, he said. Qualcomm plans to test the new software and challenge it in court if it believes the patents are still being infringed upon, a company official said. The company is also seeking an order covering the newest iPhone models, the XS, XS Max and XR. If Apple has \u201cnot properly patched the phones, they would be playing with fire\u201d and could face fines or other penalties for being in contempt of court, said Mr. Clark, who has served as outside counsel for Qualcomm before but isn\u2019t presently doing so. \u201cThat\u2019s where the risk is,\u201d he said. So far, Apple has avoided a sales disruption in China and hasn\u2019t faced a major backlash from the public or media. Local media reports have been measured in tone, focusing on the developments of the case and introducing views from legal experts. Though Apple doesn\u2019t break down sales by models, RBC Capital Markets estimates the older models affected by the court ruling account for about 40% of sales in China, equaling about $12 billion in revenue. The order applied to iPhone X, 8, 7, 6 and 6s models. The court\u2019s review of Apple\u2019s request for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction could be completed in the coming weeks, legal experts said. The judge could take about three to six months to reach a final decision in the case, said Dragon Wang, a Beijing-based intellectual property lawyer at Dunlap Bennett & Ludwig. The court in Fujian province overseeing the Apple-Qualcomm case previously issued preliminary injunctions against two American companies in favor of Chinese plaintiffs over the past year. Those companies were Micron Technology Inc., a chip company, and Veeco Instruments Inc., a tool maker. Both of those American companies stopped selling some of their products in China, said Mark Cohen of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, a former senior counsel in China for the U.S. Patent and Trade Office. A \u201cpolitical narrative is not beyond the realm of possibility,\u201d he said. The U.S. and China remain engaged in a battle over trade and technology, with both countries imposing tariffs on the other.

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s plan to add thousands of jobs in Austin, Texas, San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., draws a road map of its transformation away from its identity as an iPhone maker toward a future reliant on services and higher-priced devices. Each location where it announced expansion plans Thursday reflects a different facet of Apple\u2019s evolving model. Culver City gives Apple a Hollywood homebase as it pushes into video programming. Seattle is a machine-learning hub where it can develop algorithms that personalize streaming-music playlists and improve Siri. San Diego and Austin offer semiconductor engineers who can advance the customized-chip efforts that help Apple wring more money out of its iPhones, iPads and Macs. The mix of software and services and higher prices are key to Apple\u2019s effort to offset slowing iPhone unit sales. Though the company reported record annual revenue on Nov. 1 due to higher iPhone prices, it also said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones sold\u2014a metric that has been stagnant lately\u2014a decision that many analysts interpreted as signaling the iPhone\u2019s growth years are in the past. Apple\u2019s stock price has declined by nearly a quarter since then. While the push beyond its Silicon Valley home could aid those efforts, it also will test a highly centralized company that has thrived due to a concentrated workforce located near its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, analysts said. Source: the company \u201cThis idea of \u2018Designed in Cupertino\u2019 has really been the ethos of Apple, and now you\u2019re going to have AI and services designed outside Cupertino,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at investment and research firm Loup Ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s a shift that adds complexity to the culture.\u201d Co-founder Steve Jobs wanted as many employees near headquarters as possible to speed decision making and foster a strong culture. He inspired Apple\u2019s new $5 billion campus with its 2.8-million-square-foot circular building, believing that bringing Apple\u2019s diffused staff under one roof would improve the exchange of ideas. Apple\u2019s workforce has exploded to about 132,000 employees from 16,000 before the iPhone\u2019s debut. Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, said she has visited Apple offices in London and Beijing and found they feel like headquarters. She expects offices from San Diego to Seattle will be the same way. \u201cIt might be you don\u2019t get the Silicon Valley vibe,\u201d Ms. Milanesi said. But she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a culture thing and not a location issue.\u201d As a company focused on selling devices, Apple over the past decade created millions of low-end manufacturing jobs in China at the contractors who assemble its gadgets. While such assembly jobs aren\u2019t likely to return to the U.S., Apple has increasingly emphasized adding other types of workers at home. On Thursday, Apple said it would add 1,000 jobs apiece in Culver City, Seattle and San Diego. It will invest $1 billion in a new Austin campus for 5,000 employees\u2014its second there. Apple and other big tech companies have sought to show they are creating American jobs as their clout has grown. President Trump, who has pressured Apple to bring home manufacturing jobs from Asia, tweeted his gratitude Friday to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook \u201cfor agreeing to expand operations in the U.S. and thereby creating thousands of jobs!\u201d Aside from the political goodwill, the job expansion outside Silicon Valley could help Apple diversify beyond the iPhone. Culver City is expected to be the base of a Hollywood operation to which Apple last year allocated an initial $1 billion for developing programming and poaching top talent. In January, the company leased 128,000 square feet of office and retail space in the Los Angeles-area town, which is home to Sony Pictures Entertainment and its Culver Studios, where classics like \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d and \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d were made. The additions in Seattle promise to deepen Apple\u2019s presence in a hub for machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. , along with the University of Washington and Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, have helped draw leading AI scientists to the area. Apple pushed into Seattle\u2019s machine-learning community with the 2016 acquisition of Turi Inc., a startup led by a University of Washington professor, and has kept its operations there. Machine learning is critical to personalizing software services, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group LLC, a Seattle venture firm. It helps Spotify Technology SA suggest songs that listeners might like and aids Amazon\u2019s Alexa in fielding queries, he said. \u201cThe two layers of the cake that are ubiquitously important for all apps and services are cloud computing and data science,\u201d Mr. McIlwain said. \u201cApple\u2019s got to come to terms with that.\u201d Traditionally, gadget makers like Apple have bought chips made by other companies. But in the past decade, Apple has expanded its semiconductor efforts to include the Bluetooth chip that powers AirPods and graphics processors for the iPhone. Its efforts helped enable the facial-recognition technology that it introduced with last year\u2019s iPhones, a feature that helped justify raising the starting price of the iPhone X by more than 50% to $999. Apple has added jobs in Austin, where it agreed to build its first campus in 2012, to support those efforts over time. The San Diego area and Southern California, meanwhile, have been the hub for two of the key developers of communications chips: Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom. Apple can poach engineering talent from those two companies and potentially push into their areas of expertise, developing its own modem and radio-frequency chips, said Robert Maire, president of Semiconductor Advisors, which advises on chip-related transactions. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing chip design, that would be the place to be,\u201d Mr. Maire said of San Diego. Developing a modem chip would also ease Apple\u2019s dependency on Qualcomm, he said. Apple sued the chip supplier nearly two years ago over what it called unfair licensing practices, and has been in a bitter legal battle with the company since then.",

AAPL 0.85% plans to invest $1 billion to build a second campus in Austin, Texas, for 5,000 employees, widening its footprint in a familiar region rich with engineering and business talent as it joins other tech giants in expanding beyond the West Coast. The iPhone maker laid out its strategy Thursday in an announcement about new jobs it will add across the country. The move would be a step toward fulfilling a pledge made in January when it said it would invest $30 billion in capital spending and create 20,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next five years. Apple said it would add more than 1,000 employees apiece in San Diego, Seattle and Culver City, Calif., areas where it has been increasing staff to support its development of custom chips, machine-learning systems and Hollywood programming. It also plans hundreds of additional jobs in cities where it already has offices, including New York, Boston and Portland, Ore. The Austin campus would have the capacity to eventually accommodate 15,000 employees, Apple said, and was expected to make the company the city\u2019s largest private employer. Source: the company The announcement came weeks after Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. GOOG 0.03% said they would expand in regions where they already have a presence. Amazon last month awarded campuses to New York and Northern Virginia, bringing 25,000 jobs to each area; Alphabet said its Google unit would double its workforce in New York to more than 14,000 over the next 10 years. The tech industry\u2019s growth in recent years has challenged companies to push beyond their headquarters for new talent, particularly as living costs rise and options for nearby expansion dwindle. Instead of spreading operations into new pockets of the country, though, the companies have opted for familiar locales where they already have a presence. \u201cYou have an element of bet-the-company on each location,\u201d said Jeff Forsythe, an adviser with the consulting firm Forsythe & Associates Inc., which helps companies choose new sites. \u201cIf you\u2019re comfortable doing business in an area, it doesn\u2019t hurt to grow in the same area.\u201d All three companies have been eager to claim credit for creating American jobs as their power grows and their market values soar. President Trump has applied specific pressure to Apple, calling on it repeatedly to bring manufacturing jobs home from Asia. Apple\u2019s choice of Austin is a surprise in one respect. After the company said in January it would select the location of a new campus by year\u2019s end, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the facility would be outside of California and Texas, where Apple already has substantial operations. An Apple spokeswoman declined to say if the Austin expansion is the promised new campus. The company in its announcement said there is potential for additional expansion in the U.S. over time. In making its decision, Amazon also pivoted late in its process, opting to spread what was supposed to be a second headquarters with 50,000 jobs across two locations. Apple and Amazon approached their campus searches and announcements differently. Apple discreetly explored options in markets such as North Carolina and Northern Virginia, according to people familiar with the search. The company announced its selection of Austin overnight. Amazon, meanwhile, held a more than yearlong, public search with the fanfare of an Olympics host-city selection process. The e-commerce giant received 238 proposals and winnowed the list to 20 finalists before trumpeting its choice of Northern Virginia and New York\u2019s Long Island City neighborhood in the morning hours of Nov. 13, maximizing its potential for attention. It also said it was creating more than 5,000 jobs at a new campus in Nashville, Tenn. The expansion comes as business challenges mount for Apple. Its shares have dropped more than 25% since early October, shedding more than $300 billion in market value, driven in part by investors\u2019 concerns about the future of the iPhone. In Austin, Apple committed to spending at least $400 million on the campus, according to its 15-year pact with Williamson County, where the campus will be located. The company said those jobs would be in areas including customer support, engineering, finance, sales and operations. In exchange, the governor\u2019s office said the state has pledged to extend $25 million to Apple from the Texas Enterprise Fund, contingent on Williamson County passing a property-tax package next Tuesday that would give Apple a 65% tax break annually. Those incentives are in addition to $21 million the state committed in 2012 over 10 years for Apple\u2019s current Austin campus, which has doubled the company\u2019s local workforce. Apple now employs 6,200 people in the area, the largest concentration of Apple employees outside of its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. A longtime lure of Austin, which once promoted itself as the Silicon Hills, has been its low cost of living compared with San Francisco and New York, as well as its lack of a state income tax. The metro-area population of 2.1 million residents is younger and better educated than the rest of Texas and the U.S. It hosts music festivals throughout the year and has a surfeit of high-end restaurants. That has made it attractive to the type of younger workers companies want to hire. Austin was a dark horse in the quest to land Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, dubbed HQ2. Google and Facebook Inc. also have opened large offices in Texas\u2019 capital city. The area is home to Dell Technologies Inc., while chip giant NXP Semiconductors NV has a major presence there after buying Freescale Semiconductor in 2015. Many videogame companies have studios around town. Texas has more representation in Washington than other states Apple considered, potentially giving Apple more clout on Capitol Hill at a time when tech companies face increasing scrutiny over issues such as digital privacy and antitrust, said John Boyd, principal at the Boyd Co., a site-selection firm. Austin also has been one of two U.S. locations where Apple has manufacturing operations. In 2012, amid mounting criticism of its reliance on overseas manufacturing, Apple said it would invest $100 million to make the Mac Pro its first \u201cAssembled in the USA\u201d product in years. The project in Austin was led by Flex Ltd. Mr. Trump has renewed calls for Apple to shift manufacturing to the U.S. from China, where most iPhones are assembled. Analysts and people familiar with Apple\u2019s operations say it isn\u2019t easy to shift production out of China. Much of the electronics supply chain is based in China and neighboring countries, and many steps of assembling the iPhones still rely on the hands of hundreds of thousands of workers. The new 133-acre Austin campus will be located less than a mile from Apple\u2019s existing facilities. The company added 6,000 jobs in the U.S. and now employs 90,000 people in country, many retail workers at its stores. \u2014Russell Gold, Yoko Kubota and Stu Woo contributed to this article.",

        "content": "When Richard Linklater shot his movie \u201cSlacker\u201d on the streets of Austin in 1989, he captured a regional city where the young people were laid back, marginally employed and proudly less driven than those in other parts of the country. Fast-forward three decades and the Texas city has been transformed\u2014from a small hipster haven into a bustling and fast-paced high-tech hub. That sometimes uneasy transformation culminated Thursday with Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s decision to build a $1 billion campus in the city, adding 5,000 workers initially, and as many as 15,000 jobs over time. The announcement adds to Apple\u2019s existing Austin campus, the company\u2019s largest outside of California, and comes on top of other big new arrivals in the city, including offices from Alphabet Inc. GOOG 0.03% \u2019s Google, Facebook Inc. and the U.S. Army\u2019s Futures Command headquarters. What has made Austin so attractive? It has a relatively low cost of living compared with other tech hubs such as San Francisco, and several local universities, including the University of Texas\u2019 main campus, are churning out a steady stream of young programmers. The city has focused on attracting tech companies. But it has also worked to expand its music and film industry, anchored by several large music festivals. The vibrant cultural scene in the city, nicknamed the \u201cLive Music Capital of the World,\u201d made it easier to attract young talent, several people involved in economic development said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are writing songs or software, Austin is an environment that is appealing to people who are creative,\u201d said Jon Hockenyos, president of TXP, an Austin economic analysis and public policy firm that has a contract with the city. Another factor for tech companies has been the large number of universities and computer programmers in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the talent,\u201d said Matt Curtis, founder of Smart City Policy Group, an Austin firm that consultants with cities on technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a region that grows talent with five universities but it\u2019s also an area that attracts great talent.\u201d Michele Grieshaber, chief marketing officer of Silicon Laboratories Inc., a semiconductor chip and software company based in downtown Austin, agrees that there are many engineers who want to live in Austin. Another draw, she said, was the quality of life. \u201cWe complain about traffic in Austin, but it is infinitely harder to commute in the Valley,\u201d she said. The Austin Chamber of Commerce boasts that per-capita state and local taxes are less than the national average, and one-third less than in California. Texas has no state income tax. It\u2019s a lot more affordable for a young engineer to purchase a house in Austin\u2014for now. The median home price index for the Austin metro area is $302,100, according to Zillow, a real-estate tracking firm. The comparable price for the San Jose metro area is $1.29 million. \u201cIt is still cheaper than California, although that gap is closing,\u201d says Eric Peterson, chief executive of Descendent Studios, a videogame developer in Austin.",

        "content": "A Chinese court ordered Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% to stop selling older iPhone models after finding the company infringed on two patents held by Qualcomm Inc., QCOM 3.42% the chip maker said, casting uncertainty over Apple\u2019s business in a critical market amid thorny trade relations between the U.S. and China. The Nov. 30 decision by a Chinese court, which doesn\u2019t apply to new iPhone models launched this year, is the first in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market that seeks to curtail iPhone sales in the country. Apple said its full portfolio of iPhones in China remain on sale, and that it plans to appeal the court\u2019s decision. The company filed a request to the court to reconsider its decision on Monday. Qualcomm said the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court in China found Apple had infringed on two patents: one related to photo editing and another to swiping on a touch-screen device. The court order barring import and sales covers the iPhone X, 8, 7 and 6 models. It didn\u2019t include Apple\u2019s newest devices\u2014the XS, XS Max and XR\u2014because those models weren\u2019t on the market when the patent case was filed. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear when any such ban might take effect. Apple already has phased out selling some iPhone models globally, including the 6s, 6s Plus and X. As of Monday, Apple\u2019s China website was still selling the iPhone 7 and 8 family of phones, as well as the newest releases. When Micron Technology Inc. received a similar injunction in July from the same Chinese court in a patent case, Micron complied with the decision by ending sales of some memory products in China while requesting the court reconsider its ruling. The injunction ruling came in patent infringement cases brought by United Microelectronics Corp. and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., a Taiwanese chip company and a Chinese chip company that Micron sued in the U.S. for intellectual-property theft. The preliminary injunction is the latest turn in a long-running legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm. The San Diego chip company has brought more than a dozen cases against Apple over patent infringement in China over the past two years. Apple has built a sizable business in China, relying on the country for about a fifth of its annual revenue. The iPhone maker doesn\u2019t break down sales by models, and analysts\u2019 estimates vary. RBC Capital Markets on Monday estimated older models account for about 40% of sales in China, and that the ban could have an impact on about $12 billion in sales. The ruling comes as China and the U.S. have been locked in a monthslong trade battle. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods, alleging unfair trade practices and intellectual-property theft. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. goods. A new rift between the countries opened this month after Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s finance chief was arrested in Canada on behalf of U.S. authorities. She is accused of lying to banks about Huawei\u2019s ties to a company that did business in Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions. The companies both said they were informed of the Chinese court\u2019s decision last week. Qualcomm said the decision was dated Nov. 30, which would be a day before the arrest of the Huawei executive. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with the investment bank UBS, said the timing of the decision raises the possibility that it is related to the broader U.S.-China trade dispute. He said Qualcomm has been in the process of validating some 23 patents in China for about a year, but this is the first court decision in Qualcomm\u2019s favor on those patents. \u201cThe timing seems suspect to say the least,\u201d Mr. Arcuri said. \u201cThis was a very convenient way to bring Apple into the fray in the same way the U.S. government did with Huawei.\u201d Apple and Qualcomm have been engaged in a wide-ranging legal battle for nearly two years. The dispute began in January 2017, when Apple filed a lawsuit over Qualcomm\u2019s practice of collecting royalties on the entire sales price of an iPhone up to $400. Qualcomm says it charges a percentage of an entire device because its patents, essential to implementing cellular-communication standards, relate to cellular devices as a whole, not just its chips. During the dispute, Apple has withheld billions in royalty payments from Qualcomm. The chip maker has responded by suing Apple for infringing on Qualcomm patents in the U.S., China and Germany. It is seeking an injunction on iPhone sales in those markets, which analysts say is a part of a strategy to pressure Apple to negotiate a resolution to the licensing dispute. Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said during an appearance on CNBC in November that the companies are \u201con the doorstep\u201d of a resolution. However, Apple\u2019s attorneys have said in court proceedings in San Diego that the parties aren\u2019t engaged in settlement discussions.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% conducted an investigation earlier this year into possible business misconduct within its supply chain\u2014including possible kickbacks and bribes\u2014rattling some of the tech giant\u2019s suppliers and staff in China. The company in May inquired with at least one supplier about possible kickbacks to Apple employees, according to people familiar with the probe. In response to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s questions, an Apple spokesman acknowledged the investigation and said the company found no evidence of bribery or kickbacks. \u201cWe have over 2,300 operations employees in China and, while misconduct issues are rare, we take any allegations very seriously and investigate each one thoroughly,\u201d the spokesman said. He declined to disclose what prompted the probe or its findings. Inside Apple, the supply-management team in China handling nonelectrical components for iPhones experienced some turnover this year. A top procurement executive left in May, and two junior members of the team exited Apple around that time, according to people familiar with the departures. The reasons for their exits aren\u2019t clear. Apple declined to comment on the departures. The companies that were questioned in connection with the probe continue to supply Apple, people familiar with the investigation said. Changing suppliers of key components could disrupt iPhone production. The probe has been a source of concern for some Apple staff and suppliers amid this year\u2019s iPhone cycle, primarily in the segment tied to nonelectrical components, the people said. The company has thousands of suppliers and supply-management employees spread across China and the U.S. Apple has strict rules for its employees on dealing with suppliers, said Apple suppliers and former staff. Apple employees working on parts procurement cannot accept gifts from suppliers or go out for lavish meals, they said. It also spells out rules for suppliers. According to its \u201cSupplier Code of Conduct\u201d on the company\u2019s website, Apple suppliers \u201cshall not engage in corruption, extortion, embezzlement, or bribery to obtain an unfair or improper advantage.\u201d The possibility of corruption has been a challenge for businesses operating in China, said Daniel C.K. Chow, a professor of business law at Ohio State University who has testified before the U.S. International Trade Commission on Chinese business practices. For example, Mr. Chow said, the country\u2019s pharmaceutical industry long depended on drug-sales executives paying doctors for prescribing their medications, a practice GlaxoSmithKline was found guilty of in China in 2014. JPMorgan Chase & Co. settled a case with the U.S. government over a scheme to hire relatives of powerful government officials in Asia to win business. JPMorgan agreed to pay $264 million and admitted it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. firms from paying bribes to foreign governments to win business. Apple had a kickback scandal of its own in 2010 involving Paul Shin Devine, a global supply manager, who was accused of receiving more than $1 million in kickbacks from six Apple suppliers in Asia. He was arrested in the U.S. and sentenced to about a year in prison and fined about $4.5 million in restitution after admitting to taking payoffs from suppliers. \u2014Yang Jie in Beijing contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Microsoft Corp. briefly unseated longtime rival Apple Inc. on Tuesday as the world\u2019s most valuable company, reflecting investors\u2019 faith in its revival under Chief Executive Satya Nadella while the iPhone maker adjusts to slowing momentum for its most profitable product. Shares in Microsoft opened at $106.27, pushing its market capitalization to $815.75 billion, elbowing past Apple\u2019s opening value of $813.88 billion. After the first minute of trading, Apple was back on top. The two swapped spots several times later in the day before Apple at the close reclaimed the title it has held for most of the past seven years. Apple finished with a market value of $826.84 billion while Microsoft was at $822.43 billion. Market values are calculated using data provided by FactSet, which draws information from public filings. The move comes nearly four months after Apple became the first U.S. company to surpass $1 trillion in market value, an achievement since matched by Amazon.com Inc. Both companies\u2019 shares fell below that mark in recent weeks as investors dealt tech a sharp blow. Apple peaked at $1.103 trillion on Oct. 3, but has shed nearly $300 billion in market value since, in part to do with investors\u2019 concerns about the future of the iPhone. President Trump added to those concerns, telling The Wall Street Journal Monday that tariffs could be placed on Apple hardware imported from China. \u201c Microsoft has already made the switch to a services business. Apple is trying to do that, and they probably will, but the question is: At what pace? \u201d Apple first took the crown as the largest company by market capitalization in August 2011, when it edged out Exxon Mobil Corp. in a symbolic moment underscoring that tech\u2014not oil\u2014was king. At the time, Apple was valued at roughly $340 billion, with Microsoft at a little more than $200 billion. Microsoft\u2019s resurgence hasn\u2019t been flashy. The company built its recent fortunes in the cloud, a market analysts say has delivered only a fraction of its future growth. But doing so involved letting go of the past\u2014specifically a not-invented-here mind-set that stopped Microsoft from working with the rising technologies of its peers. These days, Microsoft\u2019s best-known apps are on smartphones run by Apple and Google operating systems. It also is placing forward-looking if less-certain bets on opportunities such as augmented reality and voice recognition, building on those efforts as well as its cloud business with acquisitions big and small. \u201cMicrosoft has already made the switch to a services business. Apple is trying to do that, and they probably will, but the question is: At what pace?\u201d said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates, which has $750 million under management with about $107 million invested in Microsoft and $3.5 million in Apple. \u201cThat may not be a problem for the company, but it could be for the stock price,\u201d he said. \u201cApple has to prove there are other legs to the stool\u201d that can match the iPhone. Nabbing the top market-cap spot is a stunning reversal for Microsoft, a 43-year-old company that last held it on Nov. 3, 2003, at about $289 billion, dwarfing Apple\u2019s market value at the time of about $8 billion. Back then, Microsoft was still feared for the dominance of its Windows operating system, which it had used as a powerful launchpad to muscle into adjacent markets such as web browsing and streaming media. It was years before the launch of the iPhone, a device that catapulted Apple\u2019s value and profits to unforeseen heights. Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google hadn\u2019t yet gone public and Amazon was still a young online retailer whose future as an economic force was far from guaranteed. But Microsoft fell out of favor with investors. Bruising battles in the U.S. and abroad about its Windows monopoly led to settlements with government regulators that curtailed some of the conduct that led to its rise. Microsoft\u2019s shares stagnated for much of the following decade as rivals surpassed it in mobile devices and internet computing\u2014tectonic shifts that fueled the rise of Apple, Google and Amazon. Apple passed Microsoft in value in 2010. Microsoft turned the page in 2014, when Satya Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer as chief executive. The new CEO unwound some of Microsoft\u2019s failed bets, including its acquisition of Nokia Corp. \u2019s handset business. And he expanded Microsoft\u2019s focus on cloud computing, a rapidly growing market pioneered and led by Amazon. \u201cSatya has shaken up the business model,\u201d said Mike Frazier, president of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, which has $500 million under management and bought Microsoft shares in October for the first time in more than a decade. \u201cHe\u2019s taken a startup approach and brought Microsoft to the new millennium.\u201d While Microsoft was creating new revenue streams, Apple leaned heavily on the smartphone business that turned it into the world\u2019s most valuable company. The iPhone, which made its debut in 2007, accounts for about two-thirds of annual sales and three-quarters of the company\u2019s gross profits. And while Apple continues to generate record profits, the growth in the number of iPhones it sells annually has been slowing. Facing that challenge, Apple is trying to transition from a business focused on selling more iPhones to one that charges higher prices for feature-rich gadgets while selling software and services. Apple this month said it would stop disclosing data on the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells to better reflect this shift. Though Apple has more than doubled research-and-development spending since 2014 to $14.24 billion annually, it hasn\u2019t been able to jump into new categories at the rate and pace of some of its tech rivals. The last major industry it disrupted was the watch industry, which is valued at about $68 billion, according to Euromonitor International, a market-research firm.",

        "content": "TOKYO\u2014Less than a month after releasing the iPhone XR, Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is moving to offer subsidies to mobile-network operators in Japan to shore up sales of its least-expensive new smartphone, people familiar with the matter said. The de facto discount of the handset in Japan, coupled with deep cuts in global production plans for the XR, are a sign of limited enthusiasm among consumers for the model, which has fewer features than Apple\u2019s other two new releases and costs more than still-popular older models like the iPhone 8. Major wireless carriers in Japan plan to cut iPhone XR prices as early as next week, people with direct knowledge of the plan said, without giving details of the extent of the cut. Japan is one of the most lucrative markets for Apple, which showed a 46.7% share of the Japanese smartphone market in a survey conducted by MMD Labo from July 31 to Aug. 1. The XR is available in Apple stores in Japan from about $750, but carriers\u2019 pricing is more opaque as phones are bundled with data plans. It isn\u2019t known whether the Cupertino, Calif., company plans to offer similar programs in other regions. Apple declined to comment. Apple has used marketing dollars before to discount certain iPhone models and drive sales, viewing it as a lever to manage inventory, according to people familiar with its sales and production tactics. During the iPhone 6s cycle, Apple cut production on one model then offered carrier and retailer discounts to help reduce excess inventory, one of these people said. When extending discounts, Apple has typically chosen to do so on phones made for specific markets because the cost is less than having to reconfigure the device for resale in another market, this person said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Apple has slowed production plans for all the three models released in recent months, with some drastic chops made on least-expensive XR models. Though it has been done in the past, officials at Japanese carriers say it is rare for Apple to cut the price in their market on a recently launched handset. \u201cA price cut within a month of the release is rare not just for Apple but for smartphone makers in general,\u201d said a senior official at a wireless operator, who monitors sales. Analysts say weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone XR may mirror what happened with the iPhone 5c in 2013, where sales picked up the following year. Apple\u2019s higher-priced XS and XS Max models, released in September, appeal more to tech\u2019s early adopters who typically fuel initial sales of new iPhones. \u201c A price cut within a month of the release is rare not just for Apple but for smartphone makers in general. \u201d Some Japanese consumers say the XR\u2019s price, while considerably below the XS, is too high for the sacrifices in display quality, number of camera lenses, and slower data-transmission speed. Apple\u2019s iPhone 8 has remained hugely popular in Japan for those looking for an affordable Apple handset, because it is cheaper than the XR and remained available when the XS and XS Max were released. Apple suppliers have also recently resumed making the iPhone X, the 2017 model that Apple had stopped selling at its own stores, people familiar with the matter said. In the past, Apple has produced legacy models for select markets where there is enough demand for those devices, the person familiar with Apple\u2019s sales and production tactics said. The company views it as a way to fuel sales and boost margins, as the components often cost less and manufacturing equipment has depreciated, he said. People involved in the supply chain said the resumption of the X is due in part to Apple\u2019s contract with Samsung Display, a major provider of iPhone X\u2019s organic-light emitting diode display, or OLED, panels. Apple needs to buy a certain amount of the panels from the South Korean maker, and given the cut in XS and XS Max, Apple is trying to fill the gap with the old device, they said. Apple and Samsung Display declined to comment. \u2014Tripp Mickle in San Francisco and Yang Jie and Yoko Kubota in Beijing contributed to this article.

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is in discussions with the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide portable electronic health records to military veterans, a partnership that would simplify patients\u2019 hospital visits and allow the technology giant to tap millions of new customers, according to people familiar with the effort and emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Under the plans being discussed, Apple would create special software tools allowing the VA\u2019s estimated nine million veterans currently enrolled in the system to transfer their health records to iPhones and provide engineering support to the agency. Apple in January announced its foray into the electronic-records field with a feature that allows patients to import and store medical information. Top VA officials, as well as associates from President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, discussed the project last year in a series of emails reviewed by the Journal. The emails show how the Trump administration wrestled early on with the project\u2019s goals. An Apple spokeswoman said the company has nothing to announce. The partnership would be a major boost for Apple at a time when technology companies are looking to elbow into the $3.2 trillion health-care market. Alphabet Inc. recently hired prominent hospital-system executive David Feinberg to oversee its health initiatives, and Amazon.com Inc. has joined with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a company that reduces its workers\u2019 health costs. Tech companies for years have sought, without much success, to bring together disparate troves of medical information and remove technological barriers to giving patients, providers and researchers access to health records. That access, health specialists have said, could improve care and speed the development of cost-effective treatments, but the effort faces technological hurdles and privacy concerns. The VA partnership has the potential to accelerate Apple\u2019s efforts to overcome past challenges by allowing it to tap into one of the nation\u2019s largest, concentrated patient populations, health-care experts said. To date, the company has had to take a more patchwork approach, signing agreements with hospital networks and relying on them to encourage patients to import their medical records to iPhones using the new \u201cHealth Records\u201d feature. The company\u2019s ultimate goal is to enable patients to import their records and share them with health-related apps, which would use the data to provide services like automated prescription refills, according to people familiar with Apple\u2019s plans. Apple would take a 15% to 30% cut of those subscriptions as it does with most apps offered through its App Store. \u201cWith nine million users, they will have the largest mobile platform for storing records on personal phones,\u201d said Iltifat Husain, assistant professor at Wake Forest School of Medicine and co-founder of Impathiq, a health-data analytics company. Apple first approached the VA in early 2017, according to a person familiar with the effort. Company and VA officials were excited about the project\u2019s promise because it would allow true interoperability and portability of health data between doctors and software platforms, the person said. Apple and the VA were developing the technology among a relatively small group of experts and officials which required non-disclosure agreements, according to an email reviewed by the Journal from Darin Selnick, a senior adviser to the VA secretary at the time. Some of the early discussion involved Dr. Bruce Moskowitz, a doctor affiliated with Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago golf club, who wasn\u2019t a government employee and has no official role at the VA. The Trump administration has faced scrutiny from lawmakers and veterans advocates for involving non-governmental acquaintances of the president in roles setting policy for the VA. \u201cI think the number one priority with Apple will be to have what they are already working on, portable health records available to veterans,\u201d said Dr. Moskowitz in an email to top VA officials in May 2017. Dr. Moskowitz laid out a series of goals for the technology early in the process, including the ability for veterans to find a variety of health-care facilities near them by using geotagging features and to quickly share test results and track prescriptions. He also envisioned a system that would allow active-duty troops to take advantage of the technology, another potentially-massive patient base. He presented to Apple a type of emergency application his family developed to locate medical facilities. Mr. Selnick, the VA official, challenged Dr. Moskowitz\u2019s priorities in emails, saying that Apple officials were most interested in focusing on doctor certifications, patient control of data and development of a suicide-prevention app. Apple and the VA have continued to develop the technology, according to people familiar with the effort. In a statement on Wednesday, a representative for Dr. Moskowitz said \u201cneither Dr. Moskowitz nor his family pushed Apple or the VA to use any app.\u201d The representative added that Dr. Moskowitz\u2019s goal was to connect outside experts and VA officials to improve services for veterans. Mr. Selnick said officials have had the best interest of the VA in mind. \u201cNo one was going to tell the VA what to do,\u201d he said. Mr. Selnick declined to comment about the ongoing talks with Apple. Apple\u2019s push into health fits into its emerging strategy of growing revenue through a combination of feature-rich, higher-priced devices and software and services sales. In addition to its health-records software, Apple this year added heart-monitoring and fall-detection capabilities to its smartwatch and increased the starting price of its newest models by $70 from a year earlier.

        "content": "Tim Cook may hold his nose when he takes money from Google every year, but take it he does\u2014and for good reason. Alphabet Inc., GOOG 0.03% the parent company of Google, paid about $11.8 billion in traffic acquisition costs to unnamed distribution partners in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. That happens to coincide with Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s latest fiscal year in which the iPhone maker has cited licensing payments from unnamed sources as the largest driver of growth for its Services business that generated $37.2 billion in revenue for the year, up 24% from last year. Both companies have long preferred to be vague on the details of their arrangement in which Google pays Apple to be the default search engine on its Safari internet browser. Some $4 billion a year is the most conservative view among analysts who have taken a stab at estimating these payments. Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs believes the true number is closer to $9 billion. Whatever the exact figure, it is a lot considering that Mr. Cook frequently likes to criticize the advertising-driven business models of his Silicon Valley neighbors. Asked about the incongruity in an interview Sunday with Axios on HBO, the Apple CEO admitted that Google\u2019s search engine is still the best out there. But he also touted the privacy features that Apple has built into its Safari browser, which include private browsing and intelligent tracker prevention. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect thing,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d be the very first person to say that. But it goes a long way to helping.\u201d The implication that Apple takes Google\u2019s money with one hand while making the internet giant\u2019s life harder with the other is an interesting one. Google still seems to deem the relationship valuable enough to keep paying up. The company has cited \u201cchanges in partner agreements\u201d as the main reason its distribution traffic acquisition costs have jumped 45% so far this year. For Google, something in this deal still clicks.",

        "content": "SEOUL\u2014 Samsung Electronics Co. is planning a major technological upgrade for its 10th anniversary flagship phones next year, including next-generation 5G network speeds, bigger screens and more cameras, according to people familiar with the matter. As with rival Apple Inc. \u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone offerings last year, Samsung\u2019s 10-year reboot of its premium smartphone lineup is seeking to dazzle consumers with more ambition than in years past, these people said, part of a bid by the South Korean technology giant to reverse a recent sales slump. Samsung, the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker by volume, is preparing three versions of its next flagship Galaxy S10 smartphone, with displays that range in size from 5.8 inches to 6.4 inches, the people said, versus two variants in previous years. Those three phones are set to debut in February next year, they added. In addition, the South Korean technology giant is developing a fourth variant of the Galaxy S10 that will be 5G-enabled and is internally code-named \u201cBeyond X,\u201d some of these people said. The 5G phone, slated for a spring release in the U.S. and South Korea, would sport an even larger screen, measuring 6.7 inches diagonally, and pack in a whopping six cameras\u2014two in the front and four in the back, these people said, which promise richer photos and better spatial perception. Apple\u2019s latest top-end iPhone, by comparison, includes three cameras, two on the back and one on the front. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment. After several years of declining sales of smartphones, its biggest moneymaker for many years, Samsung needs a big hit next year. The company\u2019s devices account for one out of every five smartphones shipped globally, but it suffered a major handset sales tumble this year. The smartphone\u2019s overhaul will test consumers\u2019 willingness to ditch their years-old devices for ones that offer flashier features\u2014for a higher price tag. It is an industrywide problem. Global smartphone shipments slid 8% from a year earlier for the three months ended Sept. 30, the fourth straight quarter of declines as consumers hold on to their devices longer, according to Strategy Analytics. Samsung shipments struggled even more than the industry average, declining 13% during that stretch. Apple in recent weeks slashed production orders for all three of the iPhone models it unveiled in September, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, due to lower-than-expected demand. \u201cThere are no signs of recovery for the smartphone industry currently,\u201d said Tom Kang, a Seoul-based analyst at Counterpoint Research. To stage its comeback, Samsung saved up several new features to set its 10th anniversary Galaxy S smartphone apart. Samsung is planning a mid-February event where it will unveil at least the feature-heavy 5G Galaxy S phone, according to a person familiar with the matter. The handset\u2019s release date would be pegged to whenever wireless carriers could launch 5G service, according to people familiar with the matter, which is expected by next spring. Samsung has held discussions with Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., as well as large South Korean carriers, though no final decisions have been made, according to these people. Samsung is in discussions with Verizon about a potential exclusive distribution arrangement, though the terms and length of that arrangement aren\u2019t yet final, some of these people said. With 5G, Samsung is expected to enjoy a sizable lead over Apple\u2019s iPhone, which analysts forecast won\u2019t be capable of supporting 5G until 2020. The three Galaxy S10 handsets scheduled for an earlier release than the 5G phone bear the internal code names \u201cBeyond 0,\u201d \u201cBeyond 1\u201d and \u201cBeyond 2,\u201d according to people familiar with the matter. They would each have between three and five cameras in total, based on current plans, according to one of these people. A feature considered for some phones is \u201creverse wireless charging,\u201d in which a Samsung handset could be used to recharge other devices by placing them together, according to people familiar with the matter. The timing, design and phone features for all the devices could change since decisions are still being finalized, according to people familiar with the matter. Separately, Samsung is also set to release early next year its first ever foldable-screen device, which opens like a book and boasts a 7.3-inch display. Internally, Samsung executives are debating the foldable phone\u2019s name, with \u201cSamsung Flex\u201d and the \u201cGalaxy Flex\u201d emerging as two candidates, though the decision is far from final, according to a person familiar with the matter. But even with the new launches, Samsung will face challenges in a smartphone industry dealing with consumers holding on to their devices longer and economic uncertainty brought on by global trade turmoil, analysts said. \u201cEveryone is being affected by some similar market forces,\u201d said Melissa Chau, associate research director at International Data Corp., a market researcher. \u201cOverall volumes will decline for everyone.\u201d \u2014Sarah Krouse and Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Lower-than-expected demand for Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s new iPhones and the company\u2019s decision to offer more models have created turmoil along its supply chain and made it harder for Apple to predict the number of components and phones it needs, people familiar with the situation said. In recent weeks, Apple slashed production orders for all three of the iPhone models it unveiled in September, these people said, frustrating executives at Apple suppliers as well as workers who assemble the phones and their components. Forecasts have been especially problematic for the iPhone XR, Apple\u2019s new lower-price model. Around late October, Apple slashed its production plan by up to a third of the approximately 70 million units it had asked some suppliers to assemble between September and February, people familiar with the matter said. And in the past week, Apple told several suppliers that it cut its production plan again for the iPhone XR, some of the people said Monday, as Apple battles a maturing smartphone market and stiff competition from Chinese producers. Apple\u2019s shares fell 4% Monday to $185.86, a drop that put them close to bear-market territory\u2014a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak. The stock is down 16% since Apple on Nov. 1 reported record quarterly revenue and profit but gave an outlook for the holiday quarter that didn\u2019t portend explosive growth. Apple\u2014which doesn\u2019t give public forecasts for demand or production of its products\u2014declined to comment. During an interview earlier this year with The Wall Street Journal, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that trying to determine demand for its devices based on reports from suppliers can be misleading because the suppliers also make products for competitors. The slowdown has ripped throughout Apple\u2019s supply chain. Last week, big suppliers of iPhone components including Qorvo Inc., Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Japan Display Inc. cut their quarterly profit estimates, citing a reduction in previously placed orders from a large customer. Apple wasn\u2019t named, but it accounts for a third to half of revenue for these companies, according to financial filings and estimates. Investors reacted by sending shares of the three companies sharply lower. At Foxconn Technology Co. , Apple\u2019s largest iPhone assembler, thousands of workers have voluntarily left its Chinese plants earlier than they intended after Foxconn cut overtime hours that typically are available during peak production periods, people familiar with the matter said. Many workers have come to rely on overtime as a major source of income. Foxconn declined to comment. Hundreds of suppliers built their businesses on the back of the smartphone era, and none benefited more than those providing components for Apple. The iPhone\u2019s popularity generated tremendous revenue and profitability for suppliers, lifting their market valuations as components became the backbone of their business. But the iPhone production cuts have reignited frustration among suppliers and raised worries about Apple\u2019s ability to forecast demand since it started releasing three flagship models instead of two last year, according to executives at Apple suppliers. Apple also continues to sell some older models in its stores, further complicating forecasting. Moreover, the addition of new iPhones at higher prices\u2014the devices now cost $749 to $1,099, up from $649 to $769 in 2016\u2014has created uncertainty in how customers will respond, analysts and forecasting experts said. \u201cThe more choice you introduce, the harder it is to pinpoint who will buy what,\u201d said Steven Haines, chief executive of Sequent Learning Networks, which has advised companies such as FedEx Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. on product management. In the past, Apple thrived on \u201cthe beauty of simplicity,\u201d said an executive at an Apple supplier. \u201cIt was very few models at massive volumes.\u201d The suppliers\u2019 ability to gauge demand will also be hurt by Apple\u2019s recent decision to stop reporting unit sales, one supplier said. Sales of the iPhone XR could pick up later next year, mirroring what happened when Apple launched the lower-priced Phone 5C in 2013, said Ben Bajarin, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies. He said that because those devices have fewer features than the higher-priced flagship models launched around the same time, they appeal less to tech\u2019s early adopters who fuel initial sales of new iPhone versions. The company\u2019s suppliers have been rattled before. The iPhone 6, introduced in 2014, sold better than Apple\u2019s expectations, and suppliers scrambled to meet increased orders. The following year, demand for the iPhone 6s fell short of forecasts, leaving suppliers to grapple with excess inventories and underused production capacity. Last year, many suppliers were hurt by Apple\u2019s excessively optimistic initial production forecast for the then-flagship iPhone X, which it later slashed by some 20 million units for the first three months of 2018. \u201cDoing business with Apple is very risky as it often reverses what it has promised,\u201d said an executive with a supplier. Supplier frustrations have been compounded by the lack of growth in iPhone unit sales in recent years. Since peaking in fiscal 2015, the number of iPhones sold annually has fallen 6% to 217.7 million units. While making components for 200 million-plus iPhones remains a tremendous business for suppliers, most relied on the growth in iPhones sold to boost their profits. Apple tightly controls margins and asks many suppliers to make big investments in specialized machinery to make its products, suppliers said. \u201cGrowth fixes a lot of sins,\u201d the executive at an Apple supplier said. \u201cWhen it slows, rocks start to show up in the bottom of the ocean.\u201d Apple has offset slowing growth through the higher iPhone prices and by focusing more on software and services. The strategy helped the company report its best-ever annual revenue and profit for the fiscal year ended in September; for the current quarter, it projects revenue of $89 billion to $93 billion. But while Apple has been enjoying record revenue and profit for the past year, the same can\u2019t be said for many of its suppliers. Unlike Apple, they can\u2019t benefit from services and software and rely heavily on phone volumes, suppliers and analysts say. \u201cThe freeway of Apple suppliers is littered with roadkill,\u201d said Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with investment bank UBS who tracks the iPhone supply chain. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing when units are growing and another when units aren\u2019t going to grow. There\u2019s an argument to be made now: Why take the risk?\u201d \u2014 Yang Jie in Beijing contributed to this article.

        "content": "A slide in Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% shares deepened Monday, putting the iPhone maker on track for its worst month in more than a decade as the recent technology rout continued. The world\u2019s most-valuable public company fell 4% to $185.86, bringing the stock down 15.1% in November and on pace for its largest one-month drop since September 2008. Shares are now 19.9% below their Oct. 3 peak. Apple flirted for much of the day with a bear market, generally defined as a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak. The level for Apple came when the stock dipped below $185.66, territory that would end a bull run stretching back to May 2016 if it closes there. Apple\u2019s recent slump is a worrisome sign for investors questioning whether the U.S. stock rally can regain its footing without leadership from the technology sector. The stock held up during October\u2019s stock-market rout, losing only 3%, while other highflying stocks like Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. tumbled by double digits. Apple appeared to be a safety play during that falloff, which erased roughly $5.5 trillion in global stock-market value. But a tepid revenue forecast earlier this month coupled with softening global growth, trade tensions, rising interest rates and peaking corporate profits have sent Apple shares tumbling. Other technology stocks were also slumping Monday, with Amazon, Google parent Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. , Facebook Inc. and Netflix all falling at least 3.3%. Alphabet joined the rest of the so-called FANG stocks\u2014Facebook, Amazon and Netflix\u2014in a bear market as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3%. Apple, which in August became the first U.S. company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization, has lost about $220 billion in value since its October peak. Apple\u2019s market retreat accelerated last week after two key iPhone suppliers cut their earnings projections for the coming months. Supply chain uncertainty has made it harder to predict the number of components and handsets Apple needs, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.",

        "content": "Watchmakers, caught off guard by the success of Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s smartwatch, are now trying to keep pace with changing customer tastes by introducing messaging alerts and other high-tech features to traditional watches. Brands including TAG Heuer, Swatch and Fossil Group are working with Apple rivals such as Alphabet Inc. GOOG 0.03% \u2019s Google and Intel Corp. INTC 0.85% to offer their own smartwatches or hybrid versions that offer smart functions while retaining traditional design. Global shipments of Swiss watches steadily slipped after the first Apple Watch was unveiled in 2015, a dip compounded by a slump in China sales. Despite picking up in the past two years, they were overtaken last holiday season by Apple\u2019s smartwatch for the first time. UBS predicts Apple Watch sales will rise 40% next year to reach 33 million. The tech giant is expected to move 8.8 million shipments in the fourth quarter of this year, said Francisco Jeronimo, a research director at International Data Corporation. \u201cThe global watch market has had a shock and it worries us,\u201d Daeboong Kim, head of South Korea\u2019s Watch & Clock Industry Cooperative, said in an interview at the world\u2019s biggest industry fair in Hong Kong in September. The cooperative is getting advice from Samsung Electronics Co. , the world\u2019s biggest smartphone maker, to help members develop watches with smart functions. Samsung and Apple declined to comment. Sales of smartwatches overtook mechanical watches in 2016 while hybrid-watch sales rose to 7.5 million world-wide in 2017 from almost nothing in 2015 according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Sales volumes for both watch types are set to double by 2020, it predicts. The digital divide is growing, however, as the Apple Watch Series 4 released last month added an alert system for when the wearer falls down and a function designed to identify heart irregularities. Analysts say those features target a demographic of faithful watch buyers who are typically more resistant to technology: older customers. While some traditional watchmakers have tried to move into smartwatches, many have focused on hybrids. Typically, these don\u2019t have touch-screens. Instead, they are synced with smartphones via an app and alert the wearer to messages or calls through vibrations, blinking lights or by moving the watch\u2019s hands. Via Bluetooth connection, users push buttons on the watch to control the phone\u2019s camera and music functions. TAG Heuer is one of the higher-end brands fighting back, releasing an upgrade of its smartwatch, the Connected Modular 41, earlier this year. The watch is the result of collaboration with Intel and Google. It has fitness tracking, GPS, and contactless payment. Jean-Claude Biver, TAG Heuer\u2019s chief executive, said its hybrid is having success because \u201cit really looks and feels like a real watch, but with all the information you need.\u201d TAG Heuer is owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, which declined to disclose sales figures. TAG Heuer\u2019s lowest-priced Connected Modular 41 sells from around $1,200. While luxury watchmakers are least affected by Apple\u2019s competition, more luxury Swiss watch brands are researching hybrid watches as a gateway to full smartwatches, IDC\u2019s Mr. Jeronimo said. Fellow luxury Swiss brand Hublot is focusing on limited-edition devices with commercial partners. It released 2,018 pieces of the \u201cBig Bang Referee\u201d smartwatch for the 2018 soccer World Cup that featured in-game alerts and envisages watches connected to luxury sports cars that flag performance data and open doors. \u201cWe must bring something different than what exists. We are not competing with Apple,\u201d said chief executive Ricardo Guadalupe. Swiss watchmakers that operate in a price category similar to Apple\u2014the Series 4 starts at $399\u2014are feeling the pain of Apple\u2019s competition, with the number of loss-making companies in the low to midrange market rising, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. Richardson, Texas-based watchmaker Fossil Group, which also operates under other brand names, dominates the global hybrid-watch market, selling one in three globally. The group released about 25 new smartwatches this year for brands including Emporio Armani and Diesel. Functions include heart-rate monitoring and Google Pay technology. Fossil executives thought the watches would appeal to younger buyers, but mature watch buyers are also showing interest, said Greg McKelvey, who heads the group\u2019s digital strategy. Fossil Group\u2019s Q Modern Pursuit hybrid, which sells for around $155, is one of the more affordable smartwatches. Swatch Group, one of the biggest publicly listed watchmakers, released its latest watch featuring some smart technology in 2017\u2014the Swatch Bellamy 2 which enabled users to make contactless payments. It said last year it plans to develop its own operating system for watches, dubbed Swatch OS, and launch the first products using it by the end of this year or next. This isn\u2019t the first time Switzerland\u2019s centuries-old watchmaking industry has faced a threat from technology. The rise of cheaper, more-efficient quartz watches from Japan in the 1970s similarly hit Swiss watchmakers\u2019 sales. Not all watchmakers plan to compete. Developing hybrid watches isn\u2019t an option in our price range of $170 to $570, said Thomas Swiderski, director at family-run Swiss watchmaker Adriatica. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight with Apple or Samsung, because we\u2019d make something similar but not as good. We have no chance.\u201d",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% may not want to talk about iPhone unit sales anymore. That leaves the company\u2019s massive global supply chain to do the talking for them. Lately, the word there has not been great. Qorvo, which supplies radio-frequency chips for the iPhone, cut its outlook on Tuesday morning, bringing down its projected revenue for the December quarter by 8% at the midpoint. Two other suppliers\u2014Lumentum Holdings and Japan Display \u2014scaled back their forecasts Monday. All observed the strict code of silence that Apple imposes on its suppliers, in that none explicitly blamed weak iPhone demand for their actions or even mentioned the company by name. But Apple is a big source of business for all; the iPhone maker accounted for more than one-third of Qorvo\u2019s revenue for its last three fiscal years, and was half of Lumentum\u2019s revenue in last year\u2019s December quarter, according to regulatory filings. And Morgan Stanley estimates the iPhone will drive about 50% of Japan Display\u2019s revenue this year as well. Those were just the latest data points pointing to a weak turnout for Apple\u2019s newest crop of iPhones. Particularly the cheaper iPhone XR, which launched late last month and was expected to be the largest seller of the bunch. Apple\u2019s comments about the device during its last earnings call were noticeably devoid of enthusiasm, and the Nikkei Asian Review reported last week that the company has asked its Asian manufacturers not to expand production lines for the device. What appears to be a weaker iPhone cycle is showing the downside of the giant tech companies that now dominate markets. The selloff at the world\u2019s largest company by market cap is also dragging down many in its vast network of component suppliers and manufacturers. Much of that network is made up of smaller companies that have grown to depend on Apple and its iconic smartphone for large chunk of their businesses. In a list of 40 Asia-based Apple suppliers, Morgan Stanley estimates that 18 depend on the iPhone for 30% or more of their annual revenue this year. U.S.-based chip makers like Qorvo and Skyworks\u2014both of which supply radio-frequency chips for the iPhone\u2014also draw more than one-third of their annual revenues from Apple. The big companies that supply Apple, like Samsung Electronics, Intel Corp. and Broadcom are more diversified, but can still feel the pain of slowing iPhone sales. Which helps explain why the prospect of a bum iPhone cycle is bad news for all of tech. While stocks in the sector recovered a bit Tuesday from a harsh selloff on Monday, Apple is still down more than 13% since its earnings report. The PHLX Semiconductor Index\u2014home to many of the U.S. chip makers that supply Apple\u2014has slumped 3% since Apple\u2019s last report, and that is after losing 12% in tech\u2019s Red October. That has put the index to around 12 times forward earnings\u2014its lowest multiple in three years. For a small device, the iPhone casts a very large shadow.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% shares sank further on Monday, as investors\u2019 worries deepened about sales of new iPhones after two key suppliers for the device cut their earnings projections for coming months. Japan Display Inc., 6740 5.80% which supplies screens for the iPhone XR, cut earnings estimates for its fiscal year ending in March. It said orders for its latest LCD panels would be much lower than its initial expectations for the three months ending in March. Similarly, Lumentum Holdings Inc., LITE 1.28% which makes facial-recognition components for iPhones, lowered its earnings forecast by nearly 25% for the three months ending in December, saying one of its largest customers had materially reduced shipments for previously placed orders. While neither supplier mentioned Apple by name, Wall Street responded by driving shares of the iPhone maker down more than 5%, as a tech rout led to broad stock market losses. The selloff extends a decline that began after Apple issued revenue estimates for the current quarter that disappointed investors and said it would no longer report unit sales for iPhones, iPads or Macs. Apple is down nearly 13% since the close of trading Nov. 1 just before it released earnings. Apple had no comment but referred to its previous remarks that its supply chain is complex, and that trying to extrapolate the performance of any one of its products based on suppliers\u2019 forecasts can create a disconnect between anticipated sales and actual sales. The iPhone maker is transitioning from a business driven by the number of devices it ships into one that leans on pricier products and more sales of software and services to drive revenue. Investors are adjusting to that transition, which is contributing to the stock\u2019s decline, said Arif Karim, senior investment analyst at Ensemble Capital Management. The Burlingame, Calif., firm, which has $800 million under management, counts Apple among its top 25 holdings. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going through now is a series of doubts about the balance between unit growth\u2014the number of iPhones sold\u2014and the value provided to customers, from higher prices to accessories like AirPods to services,\u201d Mr. Karim said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Monday trimmed its earnings estimates for Apple by 2 cents a share and forecast a year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments and lower iPhone sales in emerging markets because of economic challenges. However, JPMorgan said it continues to expect Apple\u2019s app-store sales and music-streaming business to deliver strong growth. Apple\u2019s stock performance has long been tied to forecasts from the company\u2019s key suppliers. In 2013, a period when the number of iPhones sold slowed, shares fell 5.5% after iPhone supplier Cirrus Logic warned of a large inventory write-down because of lower demand from an unnamed customer, believed to be Apple. Similar shares declines occurred in 2016 after The Wall Street Journal reported Apple reduced its orders from iPhone suppliers. Apple later reported its first iPhone unit sales decline for its 2016 fiscal year. Still, Ben Bajarin, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, said it is difficult to read too much into forecast cuts by Apple suppliers like Japan Display and Lumentum because Apple can reduce or increase orders at any time based on iPhone demand. \u201cThe real question is: What\u2019s the full calendar year going to look like? It\u2019s hard to predict that this far out,\u201d he said. Apple released three new iPhones this year: the $999 iPhone XS, the $1,099 iPhone XS Max and the $749 iPhone XR. Analysts expected the lower-priced XR, which went on sale Oct. 26, to account for about half of total new iPhone sales. When asked during a call with analysts on Nov. 1 about how the device was doing, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple had \u201cvery, very little data\u201d on it. However, he said that the more expensive XS and XS Max models that launched a month earlier were \u201coff to a really great start.\u201d \u2014Takashi Mochizuki contributed to this article.",

        "content": "1:42 p.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was getting hit hard as Apple (AAPL) stumbled, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) tumbled, and investors fretted about the strength of the U.S. dollar. The S&P 500 has fallen 1.54% to 2738.21, while the Dow has dropped 461.67 points, or 1.78%, to 25,527.63. The Nasdaq Composite has slumped 2.44% to 7226.24. The day got off to a bad start, when Lumentum Holdings (LITE) said that one of its suppliers\u2013presumably Apple\u2013had cut orders for \u201claser diodes for 3-D sensing.\u201d It continued to get worse as Goldman suffered its worst two-day stretch since 2011 with a 10.6% decline...and counting. And don\u2019t forget the U.S. dollar, which broke through 97 to hit its highest level in more than a year. Of course, hanging over all this is the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will probably raise interest rates at its December meeting, the trade war with China, and even the possibility that gridlock is not good for the U.S. economy. In other words, it\u2019s a truckload of trouble.",

        "content": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) newest iPad: It\u2019s not just a tablet anymore! At least, that\u2019s what the company would like you to think about the device, which debuted last month. (Barron\u2019s Jonathan Swartz covered the announcement, which also encompassed other devices.) \u201cLike a computer,\u201d Apple plainly says online of the new high-end iPad Pro, a bid to set it apart from other tablets\u2014like Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Surface or Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google Pixel Slate\u2014while setting its sights on, for example, laptops. Should you see it that way? We scanned a number of online reviews, and found most reviewers wondering the same question. \u201cAfter using a new iPad Pro 12.9 for a few days, I can say that it\u2019s most definitely a refreshing, positive step forward for the iPad,\u201d Jeffrey Van Camp wrote for Wired. \u201cIt could also be called a \u2018computer.\u2019 Is it the right computer for you? That\u2019s another story.\u201d \u2022 In terms of performance, writes Nishant Padihar for Stuff, the iPad \u201ckills most other traditional laptops.\u201d He tried it on a few popular games, finding that \u201cfrom loading times to rendering complex lighting effects and even the sound through the 4-speaker layout, for something that is a hand-held computer, it really amazes with its performance envelope in such a portable form factor. Everyday tasks like switching between Pages, Google Docs, Mail and Music work like a charm with lightning speed.\u201d \u2022 Wired\u2019s Van Camp thinks the iPad blows away traditional computers when you hold it and work the touchscreen, or write and draw with the Apple Pencil. \u201cAs a more traditional work PC, it sometimes struggles. In a pinch, the iPad Pro and its Smart Keyboard are usable,\u201d he wrote. (And, of course, the Pencil and keyboard cost extra.) But after listing a range of everyday challenges, many of them software-related, he said that \u201dIt doesn\u2019t feel like the world is ready to treat my iPad as an equal to a PC yet\u2014even if that iPad is a lot more powerful and user friendly.\u201d \u2022 While we\u2019re discussing things you need to buy, here\u2019s Nilay Patel for The Verge, who noted that there\u2019s no headphone jack\u2014\u201ca curious omission since so many iPads are used essentially as televisions, and so many pro media workflows demand low-latency audio monitoring. Apple put AirPods in the reviewer package, so the company isn\u2019t being entirely shy about how it expects iPad Pro customers to solve this problem. (That\u2019s now a total of $2,356 for this iPad, in case you\u2019re keeping track.)\u201d \u2022 There is a port that can be used for headphones, however. And the sound is good, according to Ars Technica\u2019s Samuel Axon. \u201cI was surprised by how full the sound from the speakers sounded,\u201d Axon wrote. \u201cWith mobile devices, speakers are often good enough for speakerphone Skype conversations, or to share a funny YouTube video with your friends. But I would listen to music or watch a movie on these speakers. They\u2019re obviously not as good as something audio-centric like a HomePod or Sonos One, but they\u2019re great for a mobile device.\u201d \u2022 CNET\u2019s Scott Stein has an accessible cost breakdown in his review. \u201cThe iPad\u2019s price has gone up, to $799 for the 11-inch version with 64GB compared with $649 last year for the 10.5 inch. The 12.9-inch version costs $999 for 64GB of storage. My top-of-the-line review unit, with a crazy 1TB SSD and cellular data, is $1,899,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAdd in the new and improved Apple Pencil (increased in price from $99 to $129), that new fancy Smart Folio keyboard case ($179 or $199, up from $159), and new USB-C dongles and headphone adapters you\u2019ll need, and that\u2019s one expensive iPad.\u201d \u2022 Gareth Beavis discussed design for TechRadar. \u201cThe first thing you\u2019ll notice when picking up the new iPad Pro 12.9 is that it\u2019s BIG,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re talking gargantuan in your hands\u2014well, that is if you\u2019ve not used one of the other 12.9-inch models before. The reason we add that caveat is because, to our eye, one of the most impressive things about this new, ginormous tablet is that it doesn\u2019t actually feel that big. Having used the previous iPad Pro 12.9 models, this one feels like their futuristic cousin.\u201d \u2022 Digital Trends\u2019 Arif Bacchus compared the iPad to the Google Pixel Slate, concluding that \u201cit\u2019s better to choose the iPad Pro for now.\u201d The things you can\u2019t do with a base-level iPad aren\u2019t generally because of the hardware, they\u2019re because of the software, and the iPad Pro, unfortunately, still runs the same software. That puts the Pro miles behind more flexible Windows 2-in-1s such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 when it comes to running workflows like office apps, Photoshop, Lightroom, or, say, Toon Boom animation software. The Pro just can\u2019t step up. Its operating system and applications won\u2019t let it. So what should you do with one? \u201cFor drawing, word processing, web browsing, a bit of photo editing, some content consumption, and gaming, an iPad turned into a 2-in-1 is efficient, no-nonsense, and virus-free. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an Editors\u2019 Choice and one of the products we most recommend,\u201d Sascha Segan wrote for PC Mag. \u201cThe things you can\u2019t do with a base-level iPad aren\u2019t generally because of the hardware, they\u2019re because of the software, and the iPad Pro, unfortunately, still runs the same software,\u201d Segan wrote. \u201cThat puts the Pro miles behind more flexible Windows 2-in-1s such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 when it comes to running workflows like office apps, Photoshop, Lightroom, or, say, Toon Boom animation software.

Its operating system and applications won\u2019t let it.\u201d \u2022 All told, if it\u2019s a computer, it\u2019s a flawed one, wrote David Pierce for The Wall Street Journal. \u201cApple\u2019s iOS makes the iPad act more like a smartphone than a supercomputer,\u201d Pierce wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s still not good enough at simple things like file management or window handling. Many of its most powerful apps aren\u2019t as full-featured as their desktop counterparts. The new iPad Pro is a seriously impressive piece of hardware. But design, as Mr. Jobs himself liked to say, is how it works. And replacing my laptop with it didn\u2019t quite work.\u201d This story has been updated since it was first published to add the PC Mag review.

Apple (ticker: AAPL) is cutting phone production, automotive markets are slowing, and industrial markets are decelerating, albeit from a healthy level. All in all, the economy is looking a little wonky. Cyclical stocks\u2014the ones with the tightest link to the economy\u2014have suffered as a result. The technology hardware components of the S&P 500 are in correction territory after dropping over 10% from their Oct. 3 high. But there are pockets of strength. Piper Jaffray analyst Harsh Kumar writes that \u201c5G was the most pervasive, positive commentary\u201d across semiconductor third-quarter earnings calls. He added, \u201c5G network infrastructure is real, and it is happening now.\u201d 5G refers to the fifth generation of wireless technology. This is literally the upgrade from 4G and 4G LTE communications infrastructure. Intel (INTC) says that 5G will offer 10 times less latency, 50 times more speed, and 1,000 times more capacity. The step up is a big deal for the communication-service value chain. Kumar told Barron\u2019s that five to 10 times the data will be going in and out of a 5G base station, while antennae are more complex, and connections everywhere will need upgrades. \u201c5G spending will be orders of magnitude beyond the 4G cycle,\u201d he said.

Capital and test-equipment providers, at the leading edge of 5G deployment, have been talking about 5G trends for a while. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) told investors at a recent conference that its 5G business has grown double or triple digits for 11 straight quarters. National Instruments (NATI) called 5G a \u201cmajor growth opportunity\u201d on its most recent quarterly conference call. National Instruments helps its customers design 5G products. They\u2019re not the only ones. Chip makers Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN) reported double-digit growth in their communications-service business even as investors worried about the impact that a data center-spending slowdown could have on the semiconductor industry. And Cisco Systems (CSCO) added that its customers have started to engage in earnest at the 2018 Mobile World Congress. Those are customers like AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) that are at the forefront of 5G implementation. AT&T purchased Fiber-Tower Corporation in February to gain access to broadcast bandwidth that will accelerate its entry into 5G services. Verizon bought Straight Path Communications in 2017 for the same reason. Verizon has also begun installing 5G home service in four U.S. markets this year and is planning a broader rollout of the technology in 2019. The 5G rollout doesn\u2019t just affect the U.S. China is the most aggressive adopter of 5G technology and will have multiple base stations in dense urban areas functioning by next year. Things are moving ahead quickly. Global internet traffic is measured today in zetabytes. That\u2019s a one with 21 zeros after it. Cisco predicts that internet traffic will grow more than 20% a year until at least 2021. That\u2019s a lot of data, and it is going to require 5G infrastructure. In fact, 5G could usher in an era of unconstrained data transfer. If that\u2019s the case, we might be entering a brave new world that makes science fiction a reality. Stay tuned.",

        "content": "Can the news get any worse for the Apple (AAPL) supplier stocks? Sure. But it might not matter. After all, suppliers received a double whammy of disappointing Apple earnings and an iPhone XR production cut that knocked Apple down 9% over the past couple of days. But the 52 Apple suppliers Barron\u2019s tracks, including Qualcomm (QCOM), Western Digital (WD) and Intel (INTC) to name three, are down only about 1% in aggregate on those news items. The supplier group did led the way down though. They\u2019ve fallen about 8% this year, and are down over 9% since October 4, when Bloomberg reported tiny chips were placed in servers sold to Apple. The allegations of hardware hacking against server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) hit the group hard, despite the company\u2019s claim on Oct. 19 that inserting an unauthorized component on a mother board was \u201cpractically impossible.\u201d The U.S.-China trade conflict and a weakening demand outlook have also hit the shares. Today\u2019s report that Apple is dialing back production levels for its new iPhone XR could be seen as just another piece of bad news, except for the fact that it isn\u2019t sending suppliers lower. That suggests there is enough fear already reflected in the stocks. The semiconductors certainly look sufficiently beaten up. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down about 17% from its highs and is trading for about 11.4 times forward earnings. That is a significant discount to history and at levels not seen since 2012. So any hint that 2019 could be better than expected, or even a small thaw in the trade conflict could be big positive for the supplier group. And it should go without saying that a positive resolution to the hardware hacking story would be another big positive. Apple management didn\u2019t update their comments about the hack on the quarterly conference call. Management did talk about trade negotiations briefly and said they are hopeful things will work out. Are we making too big a deal about Apple and its suppliers? We think not. Apple has its own gravitational pull. Its market value is close to $1 trillion, and its suppliers have a $1 trillion market cap as well. To put that in perspective, General Motors \u2018 (GM) top 10 largest suppliers have a market value about three times as large as GM, but only total $160 billion. Charles Wilson, defense secretary for President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s was supposed to have said \u201cwhat\u2019s good for General Motors is good for America.\u201d That was probably true back then, and it is probably true for Apple today. Its definitely true for Apple\u2019s suppliers.",

        "content": "To the Polls. Monday was a mixed day for stocks, as the Dow closed up 191 points but the Nasdaq fell 0.4% under the weight of Apple\u2019s tanking stock. All eyes are now focused on Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we... The major indexes ended mixed as the S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 2738.31, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 190.87 points, or 0.7%, to 25,461.70 but the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4% to 7328.85. There was a simple reason for that mixed market; two of them actually. They were Apple (AAPL),which continued to tumble following last week\u2019s earnings report, and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), which rose after reporting earnings over the weekend; Berkshire doesn\u2019t trade on the Nasdaq. What does this have to do with the election? Nothing, and that\u2019s the point. Companies matter. Stocks matter. Earnings matter. For the market, politics doesn\u2019t matter, and I say that knowing that the Dow could tumble after the results come in. But consider what\u2019s been driving the market this year. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Torsten Sl\u00f8k highlight\u2019s two opposing narratives. The bulls argue that economic and earnings growth are strong, and both will continue thanks to the tax cuts that kicked in this year, even if Treasury yields continue to rise. Bears, meanwhile, are contending that central banks are draining the world of excess liquidity, while the U.S. issues a ton of new Treasuries. Tighter financial conditions and higher Treasury yields will cause credit spreads to widen, and stocks to fall. Sl\u00f8k believes the former will win out over the latter, though not without some bumps along the way. \u201cThe bottom line is that we see volatility higher, rates gradually higher, credit spreads gradually wider, and equities higher,\u201d he says. Notice anything about those two arguments? Neither depends on the outcome of the election. And ultimately, the election shouldn\u2019t be what determines whether stocks go up or down. \u201c[At] the federal level, this election\u2019s legacy will be seen mostly in politics, not policy, so we see limited investment implications,\u201d writes Justin Waring of UBS. \u201c[Some] investors\u2019 political fears overshadow their investment decisions, to often-disastrous results. Learning from their mistake, we have one recommendation: express your political views with a vote, not with a trade.\u201d Amen. EQT (EQT) shot to the top of the S&P 500, on a brighter outlook for natural gas. EQT gained $2.72, or 8.3%, to $35.35. EQT wasn\u2019t the only natural-gas company gaining: Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) rose 5.9%, making it the day\u2019s second biggest winner. Optimism stemmed from a rise in futures amid weather forecast calling for colder-than-average temperatures this month. In addition, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Mark Savino writes that tomorrow\u2019s carbon-tax vote in Washington State \u201ccould be a pivotal catalyst for U.S. climate policy at the state level,\u201d and \u201cbroader expansion of a carbon tax would be inherently positive for natural gas demand,\u201d benefitting EQT and its peers. Year to date, EQT is down 37.9%. \u2014Teresa Rivas Sysco (SYY) fell to the bottom of the index after reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings. Sysco lost $6.73, or 9.4%, to $64.56. The food-services company earned 91 cents a share on revenue of $15.22 billion. Analysts were looking for EPS of 92 cents on revenue of $15.39 billion. Sysco also warned that it continues \u201cto see expense challenges in the warehouse and transportation areas of our supply chain, which we anticipate will persist.\u201d Year to date, Sysco is up 6.3%. \u2014T.R.",

        "content": "Fund managers have been having a tough time beating the S&P 500 and other benchmarks. But they might have gotten some good news thanks to the big drop in Apple stock (AAPL). That might seem strange given that Apple is the market\u2019s biggest and, therefore, most important stock. But fund portfolio managers of active mutual funds tend to be underweight Apple, and overweight the so-called FANGs\u2014 Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). During a month like October, when Apple was holding up better than the FANGs, that was bad news for active managers. BofA Merrill Lynch strategist Savita Subramanian notes that large-cap funds dropped 7.5% in October, and only 41% beat their benchmarks. Large-cap growth managers suffered more than others, with just 36% able to beat the Russell 1000 Growth Index after suffering an average decline of 9.3%. Subramanian notes that the average growth fund held 1.5 times the benchmark weigh of the FANGs, which dropped 14% last month. They\u2019re underweight Apple, which outperformed the index by nearly 6 points. But now? Apple stock dropped 6.7%% on Friday after releasing earnings, and it\u2019s off another 4% to $199.27 Monday morning on reports that it isn\u2019t increasing production of the iPhone XR. Wells Fargo Securities strategist Christopher Harvey estimates that 5 to 10 percentage points of underperformance would boost active managers\u2019 relative performance by 0.15 to 0.3 percentage point. \u201cDon\u2019t expect a slide in the stock to cause a maelstrom,\u201d Harvey writes. \u201cIt has been and continues to be the most unloved, uncrowded and under-owned stock in the institutional marketplace. As opposed to causing pain, an [Apple] slide may cause [portfolio managers] to high-five each other.\u201d At least someone is.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% shares stumbled Friday as investors fretted over the iPhone maker\u2019s financial outlook for the important holiday quarter and the company\u2019s decision to stop reporting device unit sales in future results. The stock fell 6.6% to $207.48, its worst percentage decrease since January 2014 and a drop that nearly knocked Apple from its lofty trillion-dollar stock-market valuation. Technology stocks, particularly those with sky-high valuations, have slumped in recent weeks. Apple\u2019s selloff Friday removed about 100 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, contributing to the broader market's decline. The stock remains up 23% year to date. Based on Apple\u2019s current reported share count, its valuation would have slid under a trillion dollars if its stock price fell below $207.04. Shares were below that level heading into the close, but a flurry of buying in the final minute lifted the stock higher by 4 p.m. ET. The company\u2019s valuation could still change when Apple updates its share count, expected when the company files its annual report with securities regulators in the coming days. Apple\u2019s quarterly results, released after the close of trading Thursday, showed the world\u2019s most valuable public company turned in another period of record revenue and profit\u2014its fourth-consecutive quarter doing so. Apple said it had double-digit growth in all of its geographic regions, and that it continued to rake in money from App Store sales and other services. But investors seized on two points. Apple\u2019s forecast of revenue between $89 billion and $93 billion for the holiday quarter didn\u2019t portend explosive growth, with the low end of its range only slightly above the year-ago results. That sent Apple shares on a downward trajectory. And then the company said it would stop reporting unit-sales figures for its three most recognizable brands, the iPhone, iPad and Mac, while giving more details on its services business. That news knocked the stock a few percentage points lower. \u201cIt just shows the frustration that investors feel after the company out of left field pulled unit metrics,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a lot of investors scratch their heads trying to evaluate if the fundamental story of Apple has changed.\u201d Apple finance chief Luca Maestri sought to buffer the news during the company\u2019s call with analysts Thursday. He reiterated that the revenue projection still suggests the company will turn in, once again, record results. He and Chief Executive Tim Cook stressed that unit-sales figures aren\u2019t relevant to the company\u2019s financial reporting anymore. That was evident in the numbers Apple reported. While the company\u2019s iPhone unit sales showed 0% growth, the device\u2019s revenue surged 29%, thanks to the company\u2019s strategy of raising prices on its most popular gadget. The iPhone X price is just shy of $1,000, while the recently announced iPhone XS Max costs $100 more. Analysts at BTIG said Apple\u2019s decision to stop reporting unit sales could lead to speculation. \u201cApple might not think it\u2019s helpful to report unit data for its products, but we do. More data is better than less data. There is rarely an exception to this,\u201d the analysts wrote. Apple cited other reasons for its revenue forecast, including a challenging situation with currency valuations. Mr. Maestri also stressed that a year ago, Apple released its priciest phone during its fiscal first quarter. This time around, it did the opposite, releasing the more modestly priced iPhone XR during the current quarter. Analysts at J.P. Morgan said Apple\u2019s forecast suggests the company is being conservative in the face of currency headwinds and softer growth in emerging markets. In a research note, the analysts wrote that Apple\u2019s decision to stop reporting unit sales is \u201cirrelevant in evaluating Apple\u2019s success on its strategy relative to smartphones,\u201d and that the focus is on driving growth in the average selling price of the phone. The projection and the announcement of a change in how Apple will communicate its results took the shine off what was otherwise a robust quarter. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 29 rose nearly 20% to $62.9 billion from the same period a year earlier, while profit soared 32% to $14.13 billion. Both numbers beat Wall Street\u2019s forecasts.",

The S&P 500 has dropped 0.7% to 2722.18, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 115.32 points, or 0.5%, to 25,265.42. The Nasdaq Composite has slumped 1.2% to 7343.33. And it isn\u2019t hard to see why. The market\u2019s rally on Thursday started when President Donald Trump tweeted about progress being made on trade, and reports that he\u2019d ordered his aids to craft a preliminary deal added momentum to the trade. But Apple (AAPL), the market\u2019s biggest stock by market capitalization, was still dropping, and the October payrolls report confirmed that the economy is chugging along, permitting the Federal Reserve to continue hiking rates. When the White House pushed back against the trade reports, the last leg of the stool was removed. Which probably should have been obvious, anyway. \u201cIf the promise of new talks is the carrot, Trump is also preparing a stick,\u201d writes UBS strategist Christopher Swann. \u201cU.S.-China tensions run deep and will require more than a cheerful phone call to resolve.\u201d Indeed.",

The U.S. added 250,000 jobs last month, well above the 208,000 expected by economists, while the unemployment rate came in as expected at 3.7%. Average hourly wages grew by 3.1%. If investors were hoping that the payrolls report would cause the Fed to rethink further rate increases, they had another thing coming. \u201cRising wages and growing inflation pressures is why the Fed is intent on continuing their rate hike cycle,\u201d writes Bleakley Advisory Group\u2019s Peter Boockvar. That could make for an interesting day. S&P 500 futures have gained 0.7%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have climbed 240 points, or 1%, while Nasdaq Composite futures are off 0.1%. They were higher, though, and whether they\u2019ve pulled back because the Trump administration is pushing back on reports of a potential deal with China, because of the strong jobs report, or because of Apple\u2019s (APPL) earnings, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the market finished up or down 500 points. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the former.",

That\u2019s the case this morning as S&P4 500 futures have risen 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have gained 234 points, or 0.9%. Nasdaq Composite futures have advanced 0.2%. Apple\u2019s earnings had caused the major indexes to drop into the red immediately following its release, but investors have chosen to focus instead on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump has requested his advisors write up a trade deal with China. As big a drag as Apple is, the trade war has been a bigger one. If it really does come to something resembling an end, today\u2019s rally might only be the beginning.",

Apple crossed the $1 trillion mark with much fanfare in August, but the stock was off 7.2%, or $15.92, to $206.30. That put Apple\u2019s value at about $996 billion based on its July 20 share count of 4.83 billion shares. The market value probably is lower than $996 billion now because Apple has continued to be an aggressive buyer of its own stock, reducing its share count. Apple\u2019s basic share count averaged 4.801 billion shares in its September quarter, which would value the company at about $990 billion. However, the share count probably was below 4.801 billion at the end of the quarter because of ongoing share buybacks that totaled $19.4 billion in the quarter. Apple bought back $72.7 billion of stock in its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a record for any company. Apple has bought back $239 billion of stock since its buyback program began in 2015.",

Yes, the market is closed, but that trading is still going on. Apple\u2019s shares are off 4.4% at $212.45, and its loss is already being felt by the ETFs that track the major indexes. The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq-100, is off 0.7% at $170.87, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), has fallen 0.3% to $272.78, and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) has declined 0.3% to $252.96. Apple\u2019s the last FAANG stock to report earnings, and as with Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL), investors found reason to be disappointed. Now the question becomes whether the market can separate itself from Apple, the biggest component of the major indexes, or will follow it lower. Don\u2019t forget, though, that October\u2019s payrolls report is due tomorrow morning at 8:30, and could also help determine whether the market\u2019s winning streak is really over.",

        "content": "New Month, New Mood. Stocks closed higher on the first day of the month, helped by trade optimism on a lackluster earnings day. It\u2019ll take more than a three-day rally to undo the pain of October, but at least we\u2019re off to a good start. Apple was falling in after-hours after offering weak guidance. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we... Stocks rallied to start the month, as hope about trade overshadowed an underwhelming earnings slate as we finally turn the page a rough October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 264.98 points, or 1.1%, to 25380.74 while the S&P 500 rose 28.63 points, or 1.1%, to 2740.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 128.16 points, or 1.8%, to 7434.06. A presidential tweet boosted market sentiment this morning, as Donald Trump said that he has had productive talks with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping. There weren\u2019t any high profile megacaps reporting earnings this morning, but a new month and optimism about Friday\u2019s employment report were enough to keep the three-day rally going. \u201cOctober was a rough ride, and most investors are likely quite happy to wave it goodbye,\u201d says LPL Financial\u2019s Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news remains that valuations are the lowest they\u2019ve been in years, earnings continue to surprise to the upside, and November and December during a midterm year are historically quite strong.\u201d Of course, strong results haven\u2019t meant much lately, given that they were largely anticipated and investors are more concerned about management outlooks as global risks mount. Yet as Credit Suisse\u2019s Jonathan Golub writes that the idea that disappointing guidance is behind the decline is \u201crefuted\u201d by data, showing that fourth-quarter 2018 and full-year 2019 trends are \u201coutpacing historical comparisons.\u201d Certainly, some tariff-sensitive companies have been beaten up for their commentary on trade, but others, like auto makers, have been able to shrug off worries, creating a more favorable set up. \u201cDue to a small decline in earnings power for some industries and companies, and a big decline in stock prices for many businesses, we are seeking to add to positions and invest in new, high-quality enterprises at a discount to our estimate of their intrinsic value,\u201d writes Fenimore Asset Management\u2019s John Fox. Valuation is one factor drawing investors back into the market, and then there\u2019s also the continuing robust U.S. economic data, which suggests that a recession isn\u2019t in the offing. Nor does the yield curve, a traditional recession indicator, appear to be in any danger of inverting yet despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike strategy. While global growth has been easing, lower prices have helped to reassure investors that risks are now being more accurately represented. \u201cThe sharp pullback in stocks in October is another correction in an ongoing bull market, in our view, rather than the early stages of a more prolonged downturn,\u201d writes QMA\u2019s Ed Campbell. \u201cWe believe U.S. equity markets are much more likely to rebound and end the year higher from current levels (as of October 29th) than continue selling off.\u201d Sounds like something to be thankful for. Newfield Exploration (NFX) sailed to the top of the S&P 500 on after agreeing to be bought. Newfield gained $3.26, or 16.1%, to $23.46. Newfield reported earnings on Thursday morning as well, but the real boost came from Encana\u2019s (ECA) all-stock offer for the energy firm, valued at $7.65 billion, including debt. \u201cWhile we have seen several deals in the sector recently, we believe this combination is very favorable to the buyer, as the deal provides a core position in the STACK/SCOOP [Oklahoma\u2019s shale-rich regions] at an attractive valuation,\u201d writes Williams Capital Group\u2019s Gabriele Sorbara. Still, markets didn\u2019t\u2019 agree, sending Encana down 12.5%. Year to date, Newfield is down 25.6%. Allstate (ALL) crumbled to the bottom of the index, following its third-quarter earnings. Allstate lost $5.75, or 6% to $89.97. The insurer earned $1.93 a share on revenue of $8.6 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.25 on revenue of $8.51 billion. It also authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. Still, MKM Partner\u2019s Harry Fong reiterated a Buy rating and $120 price target on the shares, writing that major operation trends all point to better times ahead. \u201cWhile the company did not meet \u2018Street\u2019 expectations, it was nonetheless an excellent quarter coming in with a 15.9% adjusted net income return on common shareholders\u2019 equity for the last twelve months.\u201d Year to date, Allstate is down 14.1%.",

        "content": "HONG KONG\u2014Mobile-phone makers think they have a solution to slowing sales: smartphones with big displays that fold up like books. At least five of the world\u2019s leading sellers of phones, including Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% have sought patents for folding models, which would mark the biggest design change to the flat rectangular slabs that have been ubiquitous since the dawn of the smartphone era a decade ago. At least two companies\u2014 Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Co.\u2014have confirmed plans to release handsets with foldable displays; Huawei is targeting a release for next year. Smartphone companies see such an innovation as necessary to arrest a sales slowdown tied in part to a lengthening cycle of device replacement. These days, consumers see less of a need to upgrade for incremental annual improvements in software, screen quality and camera capability. In addition, creating displays that are larger but don\u2019t take up much space in a purse or pocket takes on urgency as service providers roll out next-generation 5G wireless networks, accelerating a boom in consumption of video, virtual reality and other visually engaging media. First, though, smartphone makers must overcome some challenges, such as developing a device flexible enough to fold in half that doesn\u2019t sacrifice display quality and durability. Other hurdles include supply-chain limitations for the required materials, higher building costs and the ultimate commercial question: Will consumers want these phones? \u201cIt will take several years to persuade consumers that these foldable phone factors will bring you good benefits, a better experience,\u201d said Jusy Hong, a smartphone analyst at IHS Markit. Regardless, \u201cthe smartphone market has matured, and we need something new.\u201d In 2017, shipments of smartphones fell 1% to 1.47 billion units, the first full-year decline in history, according to IDC, a market research firm that tracks display manufacturers. Since the first iPhone was launched in 2007, handsets have gotten a lot more advanced in terms of performance and software, but the basic look has remained the same. Innovations like the edge-to-edge screen display, which is now the standard for high-end devices including the iPhone X, haven\u2019t altered the underlying design. That stasis is in contrast to the early days of the cellphone, when models came in many shapes and sizes, from sliding phones to \u201cclamshell\u201d models that snapped open and shut, as well as others that featured actual keyboards. Last year, Chinese device maker ZTE Corp. released a phone with a folding display called the Axon M. The device, which featured two screens separated by a hinge, sold poorly and the display was panned by critics. According to patent filings, phone companies have cooked up different designs to make the technology work. In March, Huawei filed a patent application for a smartphone with a continuous screen on a book-like hinge. Apple has filed a series of patent applications for a folding device, including one that has a sketch for a device that collapses into a Z-shaped stack. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Chinese rivals Oppo Electronics Corp., Vivo Electronics Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd. have sought patents with local authorities for devices that close like a book or a billfold. And Samsung is planning to introduce a device with a folding screen early next year, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal in July. Spokesmen for Oppo and Vivo declined to comment. A Lenovo spokesman said the company \u201ccannot disclose detailed information.\u201d A Samsung spokesman said \u201cat this time, we don\u2019t have anything to share about future devices.\u201d At present, only a few firms are capable of building highly technical foldable displays. They include the display-making division of Samsung and LG Display Co. , as well as China\u2019s BOE Technology Co. 000725 0.25% , said Anabelle Hsu, senior research manager at IDC. BOE is working with Huawei on its foldable device, according to a person familiar with the matter. Foldable phones require a display panel different from those found on most smartphones. While most smartphones use a type of liquid crystal display, or LCD, a folding device will likely use a more flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode, or AMOLED, display, industry analysts said. The technology, already used for the iPhone X and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S phones, is more expensive than LCD. The material is also more difficult to source. Samsung\u2019s display-making division supplies 95% of smartphone AMOLED displays in use today, said IHS\u2019s Mr. Hong. The foldable screen also must be durable enough to open and close repeatedly over a phone\u2019s lifetime. In addition, such phones may require a more powerful battery and a significant reworking of the device\u2019s inner hardware to accommodate the redesign. And then there\u2019s the selling price. Although many shoppers no longer balk at $1,000 price tags for high-end smartphones, Mr. Hong expects the first generation of foldable devices to retail for almost double that. The market for folding phones remains uncertain, as devices with big displays are already widely available in the form of tablets and tabletlike PCs. And as concerns about excessive gadget use grow, it isn\u2019t clear if consumers will continue to embrace ever-flashier attention-hogging devices. \u201cIt seems inevitable that companies will be trying different things until somebody hits the right hot button,\u201d said Stephen Temple, a visiting professor at the University of Surrey in the U.K., who has collected mobile-phone designs over the years. \u2014Zhou Wei contributed to this article.",

        "content": "There were no real surprises at its latest product keynote, but Apple fortified its hardware lineup Tuesday with a batch of new iPad Pros, a refreshed MacBook Air, and the return of Mac mini. The new devices could give the company\u2019s non-iPhone business a shot in the arm heading into the holidays. \u201cWe\u2019re here to talk about our most creative products,\u201d Apple (AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook said to kick things off. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the Mac.\u201d (An understated ad featuring celebrities and their Macs made a compelling case for what appears to be a full-throttled renewed commitment to Macintosh.) First up, was a new MacBook Air with an upgraded higher resolution display. That\u2019s been a long missing ingredient in the popular MacBook Air line. The new computer also includes TouchID, an improved keyboard, and better audio. Apple says the 2.75-pound laptop is 17% smaller by volume. It\u2019s made from recycled aluminum (which drew loud applause). The notebook starts at $1,199 and is available Nov. 7. The return of the Mac mini prompted more boisterous cheers. Apple said it\u2019s five times faster than before, with twice the memory and more ports for connectivity. It starts at $799 and is also available Nov. 7. Next up were iPads. Cook says some 400 million of the tablets have been sold to date. The company announced new 11- and 12-inch iPad Pro models that are slightly thinner. An improved Apple Pencil, including wireless charging, addresses complaints around the company\u2019s first stylus. Apple spent time positioning the new devices for augmented reality, a recent obsession of Apple\u2019s, and as ideal for gaming. The company demonstrated a new basketball game from 2K, a unit of Take-Two Interactive (TTWO). The iPad Pros cost $799 and $999, and are available on Nov. 7. The prior 10.5-inch iPad Pro is still around, at $649. The top-end 12.9-inch iPad, with 1 terabyte of storage and cellular connectivity, is priced at $1,899. The morning product blitz in Brooklyn comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s introduction of three new iPhones in mid-September and two days before the company releases its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings per share of $2.78 on revenue of $61.43 billion, representing growth of 34% and 17%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Apple shares, which have risen 26% this year, were up 1% Tuesday to $214.92 before the event. By early afternoon the stock was up 0.6%. Analysts will spend the coming days debating whether the changes are significant enough \u2014 or priced competitively enough \u2014 to bring in new users. \u201cThe new iPad and Macs include some very welcome changes that Apple owners will appreciate,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, tells Barron\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t think Apple did enough to pull people from their premium Windows PCs to the platform, nor do I think the iPad improvements are enough to expand the market category.\u201d Apple\u2019s refreshed hardware line rounds out its new portfolio of phones, the iPhone XS Max, iPhone XS and iPhone XR. Sales of those models will have a sizable impact on the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, which ends in December.",

        "content": "BROOKLYN, N.Y.\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% on Tuesday unveiled two more-expensive versions of its Mac personal computers and a redesigned iPad, as it aims to reinvigorate lackluster sales of PCs and tablets with higher-priced devices, the way it did to strengthen its core iPhone business. The new MacBook Air marks the first full design upgrade of Apple\u2019s most popular laptop model since 2010. It has a high-resolution Retina display, narrower screen borders and Touch ID, while measuring 10% thinner and a quarter-pound lighter than the current version. The changes come at a cost: The new MacBook Air starts at $1,199, compared with $999 for the existing model. The new laptop made its debut alongside an updated version of Apple\u2019s small Mac mini desktop computer with improved processors, making it five times faster, Apple said. That starts at $799, compared with $499 for the current version. And Apple showed off new iPad Pros with narrower screen borders and facial-recognition technology, with two different sizes priced starting at $799 and $999. The announcements amplified Apple\u2019s recent strategy of boosting total revenue by jacking up prices. A year after lifting its flagship iPhone price to $999, the company is raising prices for new versions of the MacBook Air by 20%, the Mac mini by 60%, and the iPad Pro by about 25%. Though some older models will linger, the new ones should raise average sales prices of Macs and iPads and lift revenue, just as higher-priced iPhones did over the past year. Apple made the product announcements Tuesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City about seven weeks after it unveiled new versions of the iPhone and its smartwatch. The event marks the fourth time in the past decade that Apple held a second event to announce new gadgets ahead of the holiday shopping season. The new Macs arrive more than a year after Chief Executive Tim Cook and others at Apple sought to reassure anxious customers, who were concerned by the lack of Mac updates, that the company remained committed to its personal computer business. Previously, Mr. Cook had touted the iPad as a replacement for the laptop, but on Tuesday he gushed over the company\u2019s PC product line. \u201cOur customers love their Macs,\u201d Mr. Cook said, adding that the number of Macs in use world-wide has hit 100 million. \u201cApple thought PCs were going to go by the wayside and iPads would rule the roost, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, a technology analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. Still, Mr. Cook noted that the iPad has sold nearly 400 million units, making it the world\u2019s most popular tablet. While PCs and tablets have become smaller parts of Apple\u2019s business\u2014combined they accounted for about a fifth of its fiscal 2017 revenue of $229.23 billion\u2014they are important for keeping people attached to Apple\u2019s broader ecosystem, analysts say. The likelihood of buying another iPhone rises 4% if a customer owns a second Apple device like an iPad, according to research by Kantar Worldpanel. The PC market is showing signs of life after years of declining shipments. New devices that blend laptop and tablet features, such as HP Inc.\u2019s Spectre devices and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro 6, helped increase world-wide shipments 1.3% to 122.7 million units in the first half of the year, according to International Data Corp., a market-research firm. Apple\u2019s share of PC shipments has hovered at about 10% the past three years, at a time when Mac unit sales have fallen 6.5%. Apple has offset that with a 23% increase in average base prices, to keep Mac revenue roughly flat with where it was in fiscal 2015. Meanwhile, revenue for the iPads that Mr. Cook touted as laptop replacements has declined 40% from a peak in fiscal 2013. The tablet category is in the midst of a nearly four-year decline, triggered in part by bigger smartphone screens that make tablets unnecessary for many people. The redesigned iPad Pro is the first tablet to feature the facial-recognition technology that Apple introduced with last year\u2019s iPhone X. The iPads are 15% thinner than their predecessors, which debuted in 2015. They feature a USB-C charging port and work with a new stylus that Apple said is capable of charging, magnetically, on the side of the tablet. Apple devoted much of Tuesday\u2019s event to highlighting what users could do with the new devices. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. showed off its \u201cNBA 2K\u201d videogame on the iPad Pro, with graphics comparable to those more often seen from gaming consoles. And Adobe Inc. executives showed its forthcoming Photoshop for the iPad, due in 2019, demonstrating the ability to zoom in at a pixel level to make improvements to an image. On the Mac, Apple emphasized the device\u2019s speed and sustainable construction. Apple said a new metallurgy process allowed it to make every new MacBook Air from 100% recycled aluminum. The company has made a point of emphasizing its commitment to environmental sustainability now at its past two product events.",

Treasuries were lower as the U.S. stock market rallied, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising 3 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) to 3.108. The Mexican peso slid 2.3% against the dollar, the worst of any major currency, after voters polled by the party of president-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said they favor canceling Mexico\u2019s biggest ongoing infrastructure project, the $13.3 billion construction of a new Mexico City airport, although just 1.1 million people out of the 125-million population participated in the vote.

        "content": "For the fourth time in the past decade, Apple AAPL 0.85% is holding a second event to announce new versions of its gadgets ahead of the holiday shopping season. The technology giant, which last month unveiled updated iPhones and smartwatches, is scheduled on Tuesday to take over the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City, where it is expected to show off new members in its iPad and Mac product lines. Here\u2019s what you need to know: Apple\u2019s invitation for Tuesday\u2019s event said more was in the making. So what\u2019s in store? Apple is likely to unveil a new iPad Pro with speedier processors and new sensors that bring the facial-recognition technology featured on its iPhones to tablets, analysts say. The update is part of Apple\u2019s effort to reinvigorate its tablet business whose sales have tumbled 40% from their 2013 peak. Its last iPad, launched in June 2017, updated the display and processors. Though the iPad Pro, launched in 2015, carries a higher price of $649 to $1,279 and includes additional features like keyboard compatibility, Apple has been unable to return annual sales growth in a business that has declined the past four fiscal years. A new iPad will be critical to the company\u2019s efforts to remain the leader in the high-end segment of the tablet market, said Rob Cihra, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. \u201cYou have to keep refreshing the product if you want to keep a hold on the high end,\u201d Mr. Cihra said. Did you say updated Mac? Apple has caught flak from its customers in recent years for its failure to update its lower-priced MacBook Air and Mac mini devices. Though the company improved the processor speed on the MacBook Air in 2017 and updated the Mac mini in 2014, major changes haven\u2019t come to those devices in years. Analysts expect Apple to introduce a new, lower-priced MacBook that features an updated display and a quieter keyboard. Pricing of the new device will be critical to determining how broadly adopted it becomes. Currently, the MacBook Air starts at $999. The Mac mini, which currently starts at $499, has long been a popular device among families who prefer to have an Apple desktop at home. The company is expected to update the device with new processors that analysts hope will prompt many longtime users to update their existing devices. Mac units have been declining since fiscal 2015, so this \u201crefresh is sorely needed,\u201d Mr. Cihra said. Though its PC business won\u2019t become a growth driver for the iPhone maker, the new Macs could help Apple dispel the notion that \u201cthey\u2019ve been lagging the PC market rather than leading,\u201d he said. New Macs. New iPads. New iPhones. New Watches. What\u2019s up with all the Apple products this year? This week\u2019s expected updates to the iPad Pro, MacBook and Mac mini would mean that Apple is launching a record seven new devices ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. Its previous high was five new gadgets in 2016 and 2017. Apple is releasing all of these products while wrestling with stagnating iPhone shipments. That people are holding on to iPhones longer has translated into slowing unit sales of the company\u2019s most profitable device. Adding new tablets and Macs could help offset the iPhone malaise by triggering sales of its other signature products. The increase in Apple devices ahead of this Christmas fits into a broader trend across the gadget landscape that is going to make holiday shopping more challenging this year. Amazon.com Inc. announced some 70 new devices in September. Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google followed with new smartphones, a smart speaker and tablets earlier this month. And Facebook Inc. recently announced a video-chat device for the home. Could there be anything more? With Apple, there is always that possibility. The company didn\u2019t announce an update to its AirPods in September, as some had expected. Hosting the event at Brooklyn Academy of Music has prompted some Apple observers to speculate that the wireless earbuds could be part of the show. Invitations with digitally-drawn art also have raised expectations that Apple will talk about the digital stylus the company first introduced in 2015.",

        "content": "There is more pain in the pain trade ahead. That is according to Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist, who said, during an interview on CNBC last week, that a then-current market rebound belied a market that is badly damaged and ready to sink further. Wilson describes current conditions as a \u201crolling bear market,\u201d which began in February, and predicted that the S&P 500 index could fall to between 2,450 and 2,500. That represents a roughly 8% to 10% drop from the broad-market benchmark\u2019s current levels. \u201cAnd we think we get there in four to eight weeks,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cRisk-reward remains unattractive for us,\u201d he said. The Morgan Stanley analyst added that the current slump in stocks that wiped out the year-to-date return in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in a powerful move lower on Wednesday, \u201cmay last a bit longer.\u201d Wilson said the \u201crolling bear market\u201d taking shape is fueled by evaporating global liquidity as the Federal Reserve and central banks elsewhere are pulling back on crisis-era monetary policy and attempting to normalize their respective economies. He said \u201ca lot of damage\u201d has been done and said 80% of the rout may be complete. Read more: It\u2019s OK to Panic a Little About the Stock Market. Here\u2019s How to Seek Safety. Back in September, Wilson was making ominous calls even as U.S. stocks were recovering from their February corrections, where the S&P 500 and the Dow fell 10% from their late-January peak. At that time, Wilson pointed to a divergence in credit spreads and equity values as early evidence of a change in the market\u2019s complexion. \u201cDivergences between equity markets and breadth or credit spreads can also persist for longer than one can stomach before they are resolved. The bottom line is they look to us like clear signals that nice weather may not be the right forecast,\u201d Wilson said in a September note. In July, Wilson predicted that the market would see its largest correction in months, with the rally showing signs of \u201cexhaustion.\u201d He wrote then: \u201cThe bottom line for us is that we think the selling has just begun and this correction will be biggest since the one we experienced in February.\u201d He warned that the coming downturn could disproportionately hurt investors who are heavily weighted in technology and internet-related names, including some of the so-called FAANG names that have been at the center of the recent uptrend in the market by dint of their advances year-to-date and their total market weight. FAANG is an acronym for popular, large-cap tech stocks consisting of Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL). On Thursday, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index, which tumbled into correction territory on Wednesday, enjoyed the sharpest rebound among peer benchmarks, up 2.5%, after it fell more than 4%, representing its worst single-session decline since Aug. 18, 2011, according to FactSet data. All three indexes closed down sharply on Friday. And Wilson says investors aren\u2019t out of the woods. The U.S. trade clash with China, which is beginning to be discussed more frequently by U.S. corporate executives on earnings calls, is among the factors market participants point to as a key catalyst for the current downbeat mood.

        "content": "When Apple\u2019s (ticker: APPL) first two new iPhones\u2014the XS and XS Max\u2014came out, many reviewers suggested that shoppers wait a few weeks until the slightly less-expensive XR came out. Now that the XR is available, they, thankfully perhaps, still feel that way. \u201cGood news, Apple loyalists: You won\u2019t have to burn $1,000 on your next iPhone,\u201d Brian X. Chen wrote for the New York Times. \u201cThat\u2019s because for about $750, you can have the iPhone XR, which is just as fast and nearly as capable as its more expensive counterparts. The cheaper iPhone, which becomes available this Friday, is the model that most people should buy.\u201d We already rounded up reviews of the first phones. Here\u2019s a selection of highlights from reviews of the newest one. \u2022 First off: What\u2019s the difference? Edward Baig collected some of the distinctions, including different screen technology and some cosmetic changes, for USA Today. There\u2019s also screen size: The XR, he wrote, \u201chas a display size of 6.1 inches, putting it in between the XS screen (5.8 inches) and the XS Max (6.5 inches). Accordingly, the phone is slightly larger than the XS and slightly smaller than the XS Max.\u201d \u2022 Nilay Patel, writing for the Verge, went pretty deep on what the screen technology differences really mean to users. \u201cThe iPhone XR LCD definitely shifts a little pink and drops brightness quickly when you look at it off-axis, which often leads to a bit of a shimmery effect when you move the phone around,\u201d Patel wrote. \u201cI noticed that shimmer right away, but I had to point it out to other people for them to see it. (It\u2019s one of those things you might not notice at first, but you can\u2019t un-see it.)\u201d \u2022 Power users of phone cameras may wish they had the more expensive models, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern. \u201cThe XR has the same great wide-angle camera as the XS phones, but lacks the second telephoto lens for true optical zoom.\u2026With just one camera, Apple still enables Portrait Mode\u2014the setting that tries to mimic SLR cameras by applying artificial blur around a subject. Instead of using the two cameras, Apple uses software tricks to try to distinguish the main subject from the background,\u201d Stern wrote. \u201cAs crazy as it seems, this is actually a deal breaker for me, as I snap tons of photos of my son and dog together. (I did confirm, however, that the front-facing selfie camera will work for those animal portrait shots.) On the plus side, portrait shots in low light on the XR were better than on the XS since the wide-angle camera lets in more light,\u201d according to Stern. \u2022 And the phone doesn\u2019t share a touch feature with its more expensive siblings, noted Scott Stein for CNET. \u201cThe iPhone XR doesn\u2019t have the pressure-sensitive 3-D Touch feature that lets you do things like preview links, messages and files before opening them, as the iPhones 6S, 7, 8, X and XS series do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn its place, the iPhone XR gives little pulses of vibration feedback\u2014called \u2018haptics\u2019\u2014for the lock screen camera and flashlight icons. Instead of pressing down, holding a finger on them will open them. Same for the Control Center\u2019s deeper controls. It kinda feels the same as 3-D Touch.\u201d \u2022 The XR may be the least expensive of the phones, Chris Velazco wrote for Engaget, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u201ccheap.\u201d \u201cThe XR is a little wider, thicker and taller than the XS, but it never feels unwieldy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn fact, since it in sits in a nice little sweet spot between the XS and the massive Max, the XR arguably offers the best blend of size and usability. Build quality is up to Apple\u2019s usual standards, which is to say it\u2019s impeccable. The iPhone XR may cost less than the phones I reviewed a month ago, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d \u2022 If you care about phone colors, read Raymond Wong\u2019s review for Mashable. \u201cI\u2019ve been using the yellow iPhone XR for a week, and oooh, is it gorgeous,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBesides pairing well with my yellow sunglasses, the color just makes me happy. Imagine that: In 2018, when phone anxiety is real and tech companies are inventing new ways to make us use our phones less, a gadget\u2019s brightly colored paint job actually puts me at ease. The five other colors the iPhone XR comes in are just as fun. I have a soft spot for the coral after yellow.\u201d \u2022 From a buyers\u2019 perspective, Lauren Goode\u2019s take for Wired seems to sum up what many reviewers think about how to choose between the three new iPhones. \u201cThe iPhone XR is not the most technologically advanced iPhone; many of Apple\u2019s superior components have been reserved for the costlier device,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the iPhone XR is still a moderately great phone. It\u2019s great not in the way that super-futuristic, game-changing technology devices are. It\u2019s great in the way that a bunch of already-possible things have been packaged together cleanly and nicely. \u201cMost people\u2014those who don\u2019t spend their lives comparing specs and staring at bezels on multiple models of new smartphones each fall\u2014are going to be very happy with this phone if they buy it,\u201d she wrote.

        "content": "In a Pacific Northwest battle to be the second most valuable company in the world\u2014and potentially reach $1 trillion market capitalization\u2014 Microsoft Corp. is on track to overtake Amazon.com Inc. on Friday. Amazon (AMZN) has been No. 2 to Apple (AAPL) and even briefly flirted with a $1 trillion market cap in early September, but an October tech-stock swoon sent the Seattle e-commerce giant\u2019s valuation to $869.2 billion at the close of Thursday trading. That valuation appears to be headed for a healthy trim on Friday, though, as Amazon stock has tumbled about 8% following the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. If that decline holds through the close, Amazon would be overtaken by Microsoft (MSFT), which enjoyed a 5.8% gain in Thursday trading after announcing earnings a day before Amazon. Microsoft stock is off 127% Friday, trading around $107 per share. If those losses hold through the close, Microsoft would end the day with an $812 billion market capitalization. If Amazon\u2019s post-earnings decline holds, it would be worth about $799 billion. Apple became the first company to top the $1 trillion barrier in August, beating out Amazon. Amazon topped the mark in a single intraday trade in early September, but has never closed a session with that high of a valuation. Several analysts expect Microsoft to eventually top $1 trillion as it continues to successfully battle Amazon in cloud-computing while enjoying gains in cloud software and its legacy personal-computer business. Microsoft\u2019s share price would need to top $130 at current share levels to reach $1 trillion. A dozen analysts have price targets for Microsoft of $130 or higher; the average price target of more than 30 analysts tracked by FactSet as of Friday morning was $125.69. Amazon would need to top $2,045 a share to approach a $1 trillion valuation. After the e-commerce giant\u2019s earnings report, the average price target on its stock from more than 40 analysts tracking the company was $2,183.67. Only eight of those analysts have targets lower than $2,050 a share. The stock is currently trading at about $1,640. This article originally appeared on MarketWatch.",

        "content": "Value investing is the concept of buying stocks that trade below their intrinsic value, and believing that one day the gap will be realized in the market. Value as a factor has a history of outperforming the market over the long run, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from looking at recent returns. Value stocks have underperformed over the past decade, as investors plowed their money into highflying tech companies. During the market\u2019s recent selloff, however, there were signs of a comeback. While the S&P 500 has dropped 8.9% in October, the S&P 500 Value index has fallen 5%. The S&P 500 Growth index\u2014home to Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and the other FAANGs\u2014has declined 6.8%. After so many years of underperformance, it may be value\u2019s time to shine. \u201cWe find the economic rationale still holds,\u201d says Sara Shores, head of factor-based investment strategy for BlackRock, \u201cWe\u2019re comforted by 90 years of long-run data, where value time and time again outperforms growth.\u201d It seems like a good time to buy value now. Just one problem: There are many different ways to determine value. Comparing a company\u2019s stock price to its book value\u2014known as the price/book ratio and used by Kenneth French and Eugene Fama in their early factor research\u2014is one simple measure, though others prefer to compare price to trailing earnings, earnings estimates, or even cash flow to determine whether a stock is cheap or not. Each has its flaws. Cash flow and trailing earnings are backward-looking and might miss changes that are happening in real time. Forward earnings, which is based on the analyst consensus, can be more responsive to change but also reflect human error. Earnings and cash flow add a level of complication, as investors choose between, say, net earnings and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or cash flow and free cash flow. The major index providers all use different metrics or combinations to construct their value universe. The FTSE Russell 1000 Value index\u2014the basis for the $35.9-billion iShares Russell 1000 Value exchange-traded fund (IWD)\u2014uses just the price/book ratio. The S&P 500 Value index\u2014tracked by the $14.7 billion iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE)\u2014adds price/trailing earnings and price/sales to the mix, while the MSCI USA Enhanced Value index\u2014the benchmark for the $3.5 billion iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Facto r ETF (VLUE)\u2014uses price-to-book, price-to-forward earnings, and enterprise value-to-cash flow from operations. The CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value index\u2014tracked by the $42.6 billion Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)\u2014takes even more measures into consideration, including price-to-book, price-to-forward earnings, price-to-historical earnings, price-to-dividend, and price-to-sales. If we\u2019re judging solely on returns, then the two purest ETFs\u2014iShares Russell 1000 Value and iShares S&P 500 Value\u2014are the laggards, dropping 3.8% and 2.8%, respectively, in 2018. They hold sizable positions in what would be considered typical value stocks, including big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and oil giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM). The iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF, meanwhile, has fallen just 2.5% this year, thanks to a sector-neutral approach that makes it look a lot more like the market\u2014Apple is by far its largest holding. Vanguard Value\u2019s diversification of value measures means the fund has large stakes in JPMorgan and Exxon, but also Microsoft (MSFT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which has helped it keep losses to just 1.5%. Which is the right approach? \u201cValue is in the eye of the beholder,\u201d says Aye Soe, managing director of research and design at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAt the end of the day, these are just ways for the market to develop a feel for whether it\u2019s paying for what the company is worth.\u201d",

        "content": "BRUSSELS\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% Chief Executive Tim Cook issued the tech giant\u2019s strongest call yet for U.S.-wide data-protection regulation, saying individuals\u2019 personal information has been \u201cweaponized.\u201d Mr. Cook\u2019s call came in a sharply worded speech before a privacy conference organized by the European Union, which in May enacted the General Data Protection Regulation in a bid to both improve user rights and bolster the 28-member bloc\u2019s power as a global rule-maker. Mr. Cook told the audience of EU privacy regulators that the U.S. should enact a comprehensive federal privacy law that follows their example. \u201cOur own information\u2014from the everyday to the deeply personal\u2014is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cToday, that trade has exploded into a data-industrial complex.\u201d Mr. Cook\u2019s comments underscore how he is trying to insulate his company\u2014the largest Silicon Valley firm by market capitalization\u2014from rivals including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google that have grappled with recent scandals involving access to personal information. It also shows how increasingly important it is for tech firms to make their case directly before EU privacy regulators, who are now empowered to issue fines of up to 4% of a company\u2019s worldwide annual revenue. Facebook admitted in March that it had allowed information of up to 50 million users to be given to Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google had exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users of its Google+ social network. Google chose not to disclose the issue earlier this year, after noting the potential for regulatory blowback in an internal memo. Google says it didn\u2019t disclose the issue in part because it had no evidence the data were misused. Apple has argued that because it makes the bulk of its money by selling devices, rather than advertising, that it has far less incentive to exploit its customers\u2019 data. But Mr. Cook went further on Wednesday, likening the underlying data-collection practices of the targeted online-advertising world\u2014a business worth tens of billions of dollars a year\u2014to surveillance. It is language more common from privacy activists than tech CEOs. \u201cThese scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThis is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them. This should make us very uncomfortable.\u201d Apple gets relatively better marks from privacy activists and regulators in Europe because it says it anonymizes and limits much of the data it collects on users. But the company also generates revenue from digital searches across its devices by collecting licensing fees of more than $5 billion annually from Alphabet Inc. to make Google the default search engine on browsers across Apple devices, according to analysts. Some privacy advocates were also alarmed earlier this year when Apple started complying with a Chinese law that required it to store sensitive encryption keys locally. Apple said it would store the keys in a secure location and retain control over them and hasn\u2019t created any back doors to access customer data. \u201cThis issue is the goose that laid the golden egg for Apple,\u201d said Talal Shamoon, chief executive of Intertrust Technologies Corp., a data-rights-management company supportive of more privacy regulation that sued Apple in 2013 over patent infringement. He said the company can push this issue forward because it believes in the cause and depends on hardware sales rather than advertising like some of its tech peers. Plus, it\u2019s good for shareholders and puts \u201ctheir competitors in a corner,\u201d he said. Unlike Europe, the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a single piece of comprehensive privacy legislation. Instead, companies face a patchwork of privacy rules across states, including a package that California recently enacted over the objections of some tech companies, and federal laws that protect specific types of information, such as health data or financial records. Worried that other states could follow California\u2019s lead, tech companies have begun pushing for comprehensive federal privacy rules. There are at least three bills floating around Congress that address data privacy, and Washington lawmakers and lobbyists expect the issue to be at the forefront of policy discussions over the next year. Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t alone among tech firms on Wednesday in calling for U.S. legislation. Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, said the company supports a comprehensive federal law, and pointed to a set of recommendations the company issued in September, drawn in part from the EU\u2019s new privacy law. Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer Erin Egan said during an onstage appearance that her company would support comprehensive U.S. privacy law, to applause in the audience. Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), who has called for data-privacy legislation, said he was encouraged by Microsoft, Apple and others\u2019 support of regulation. \u201cToo often we\u2019ve heard companies whose business models depend on intrusive and opaque collection of user data claim that any changes to the status quo will radically undermine American innovation,\u201d Sen. Warner said in response to Mr. Cook\u2019s speech. \u201cApple and others demonstrate that innovation doesn\u2019t have to be a race to the bottom when it comes to data protection and user rights.\u201d Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg also defended his company\u2019s targeted advertising model in a prerecorded video address, saying that Facebook\u2019s goal is to offer a service to as many people as possible, and his service is paid for by advertising. \u201cYou don\u2019t need thousands of dollars to connect with people who use our services,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. But, in what appeared to be a pre-emptive swipe at rivals, Mr. Cook in his speech said companies often voice public support for data regulations but they lobby behind closed doors to weaken any initiative. A spokesman for Google and a spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment specifically on that point. \u201cTechnology is and must always be rooted in the faith people have in it,\u201d the Apple chief said. \u201cWe also recognize not everyone sees it that way\u2014in a way, the desire to put profits over privacy is nothing new.\u201d \u2014Tripp Mickle contributed to this article.",

        "content": "(BRUSSELS)\u2014 Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday endorsed tough privacy laws for both Europe and the U.S. and renewed the technology giant\u2019s commitment to protecting personal data, which he warned was being \u201cweaponized\u201d against users. Speaking at an international conference on data privacy, Cook applauded European Union authorities for bringing in a strict new data privacy law this year and said the iPhone maker supports a U.S. federal privacy law. Cook\u2019s remarks, along with comments due later from Google and Facebook top bosses, in the European Union\u2019s home base in Brussels, underscore how the U.S. tech giants are jostling to curry favor in the region as regulators tighten their scrutiny. Data protection has become a major political issue worldwide, and European regulators have led the charge in setting new rules for the big internet companies. The EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires companies to change the way they do business in the region, and a number of headline-grabbing data breaches have raised public awareness of the issue. \u201cIn many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\u201d he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries. Read more: Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s Words Come Back to Bite Him In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU\u2019s strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That\u2019s rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently. Cook warned that technology\u2019s promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening division and spreading false information. He said the trade in personal information \u201chas exploded into a data industrial complex.\u201d \u201cOur own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\u201d he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users increasingly extreme content that hardens their convictions,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThis is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,\u201d he said. Cook\u2019s appearance seems set to one-up his tech rivals and show off his company\u2019s credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google. \u201cWith the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple have the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\u201d said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook\u2019s appearance \u201cis going to have good currency,\u201d with officials, he added. Read more: Facebook and Apple Embody New Tech Divide Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google head Sundar Pichai were scheduled to address by video the annual meeting of global data privacy chiefs. Only Cook attended in person. He has repeatedly said privacy is a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and vowed his company wouldn\u2019t sell ads based on customer data the way companies like Facebook do. His speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May. Apple plans to expand it worldwide. The International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, held in a different city every year, normally attracts little attention but its Brussels venue this year takes on symbolic meaning as EU officials ratchet up their tech regulation efforts. The 28-nation EU took on global leadership of the issue when it beefed up data privacy regulations by launching GDPR. The new rules require companies to justify the collection and use of personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. They must also give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use. GDPR also allows for big fines benchmarked to revenue, which for big tech companies could amount to billions of dollars. In the first big test of the new rules, Ireland\u2019s data protection commission, which is a lead authority for Europe as many big tech firms are based in the country, is investigating Facebook after a data breach let hackers access 3 million EU accounts.",

        "content": "Among this year\u2019s crop of new iPhones, reviewers seem unanimous that less expensive is the better option. Fortunately for Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% cheaper can still be highly profitable. Apple introduced the iPhone XR last month alongside two other new iPhone models, but the company tried a new approach this year\u2014it launched the more expensive of the new phones first. The iPhone XS and XS Max models went on sale in late September, just before the end of Apple\u2019s 2018 fiscal year, at prices that started at $999. The iPhone XR hits stores on Friday, starting at a price of $749. All three models offer mostly the same advancements in terms of processor speed and features such as Face ID, though the cheaper XR uses an older display technology and it has one less camera lens. Analysts still expect it to be the biggest seller of the new models. According to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha, Apple is expected to sell about 80.5 million units of the iPhone XR in the current fiscal year compared with 40.3 million units for the supersized XS Max and 25.6 million units for the XS. That would appear to make it difficult for Apple to keep boosting the iPhone\u2019s average selling price, which in turn has been a key driver of the company\u2019s growth over the last year. But Apple\u2019s more complicated rollout this year\u2014with three new iPhone models at three different memory configurations \u2014cleverly obscures a notable price bump by adding more higher-priced devices to its lineup. This year\u2019s XR will likely play a similar role as last year\u2019s iPhone 8. Analysts believe it was the top-selling model of that cycle. The iPhone XR\u2019s starting price of $749 is about 7% higher than the starting price of the iPhone 8. All of that can help Apple continue its upselling strategy. When the company reports fiscal year-end results next week, the figures should reflect an average iPhone selling price for the year of about $755\u2014a company record, and up 16% from the previous year. Analysts currently expect that to grow to about $775 for the current fiscal year, according to FactSet. Apple is still overly reliant on the iPhone, which accounts for more than 60% of the company\u2019s total business. It is an encouraging sign, then, that its customers need the iPhone too and will keep paying up for it.",

        "content": "If history is any indication, analysts are understandably bullish about Microsoft\u2019s first-quarter earnings on Wednesday\u2014especially in the wake of its drubbing during tech\u2019s big selloff earlier this month. Microsoft (MSFT) has beaten analysts\u2019 revenue estimates 19 of the last 20 quarters, and it is expected to report earnings of 96 cents per share on revenue of $27.88 billion, each up 14% from a year ago, according to FactSet. More important, Microsoft\u2019s earnings should provide a key harbinger for the state of tech. Microsoft stock dropped from $115.17 per share on Oct. 3 to $105.91 on Oct. 11. Microsoft stock is up about 28% this year, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 3% gain. Netflix did the trick last week, with better-than-expected results and subscription growth that allayed investors\u2014and jet-propelled the stock 12% in after-hours trading. Now, it\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s turn, and analysts like the odds. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan said in a note Monday that he expects Microsoft to beat expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, driven by strength in cloud computing and more. He raised his price target to $136 from $134, and maintained a Buy recommendation. The company\u2019s shift to cloud computing is \u201ca major secular trend that is significantly benefiting [Microsoft] in the field as a key tailwind and should continue its momentum\u201d heading into fiscal year 2019, Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Friday initiating its coverage of Microsoft. He has an Outperform rating and price target of $140 on the stock. Ives expects Microsoft to join Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in the $1 trillion club within six months. \u201cMicrosoft is firing on all cylinders,\u201d Ives told Barron\u2019s. Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick summed up the sentiment in another note Monday that concluded Microsoft\u2019s burgeoning cloud business and Microsoft 365 products have greatly diversified its product portfolio to complement \u201cstrong commercial PC demand.\u201d In its previous quarter, Microsoft reported that revenue for its Azure cloud service rose 89% year-over-year, one of several factors that contributed to the first $100 billion year in revenue for the 43-year-old company.",

        "content": "Nowhere to Go. It is hard to be downbeat on a Friday, but the market sure tried. The Dow, which had been up more than 200 points early in the day, closed up less than a third of that, while the Nasdaq finished in the red. At least PayPal and Procter & Gamble got investors excited with jumping more than 8%. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we\u2026 The stock market was still looking for direction at the close of trading Friday, with the S&P 500 finishing off 0.04% at 2767.78, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.5% at 7449.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 64.89 points, or 0.3%, to 25,444.34. Market concerns about trade have recently returned after remaining dormant for a while. After imposing 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, President Trump has threatened to increase the rate to 25% on Jan. 1 and possibly add another $257 billion worth of products to the list. That would cover almost all of the Chinese imports to the U.S. Although it\u2019s reported that President Trump and China\u2019s President Xi are planning to meet for talks at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires next month, it remains unclear how constructive the negotiations can be. The market has been trying to digest the trade war, but signs are emerging that tariff\u2019s are beginning to have an impact on earnings. And with earnings growth expected to slow in 2019, tariffs could take an even bigger bite out of the market, writes Barclays strategist Maneesh Deshpande in a note on Friday. Assuming a full-blown trade war with 25% tariffs on all U.S.-China trade, the S&P 500 is likely to take a 3% hit in 2019, according to Deshpande. The trade impact on individual companies can vary significantly across the market, however. For investors looking to trade on the vulnerabilities, Barclays has some recommendations to bet against, or for our readers just to avoid. Deshpande and his team selected a basket of 30 stocks that are likely to be most impacted by the trade war. The selection is based on import and export data at the industry level, as well as insight from the firm\u2019s equity analysts. Retail stores, for example, were removed as they don\u2019t carry their own brands, but mostly sell products from other manufacturers, who are the real importers. Stocks with an Overweight rating from Barclays analysts were also excluded as they are protected by strong fundamentals and positive catalysts. Most of the stocks in the basket are concentrated in the consumer discretionary, information technology and industrials sectors, according to the strategist. Ralph Lauren (RL), Arconic (ARNC), and Mattel (MAT), would be among the hardest hit, while Apple (AAPL) also made the basket. This basket of stocks underperformed the equal-weighted S&P 500 when the trade war first heated up back in February, but then remained rangebound for much of the year. However, these stocks have started to underperform again over the past few days, an indication that investors are now more aggressively pricing in the trade risk, wrote Deshpande. Ignore it at your own risk.",

The Nasdaq Composite has slumped 2.2%, to 7479.71. Like yesterday, the S&P 500 tried to battle back. But unlike yesterday, when that rally stalled out around the unchanged mark, selling started with a vengeance. The S&P 500 Information Technology Sector index\u2019s 2.1% drop makes it the worst performing sector, as Apple (AAPL) has slumped 2.4%, to $215.80, and Microsoft (MSFT) has slid 2.2%, to $108.33. The new S&P 500 Communication Services Sector index is down 1.9%, as Facebook (FB) drops 2.8%, to $154.92 and Netflix (NFLX) tumbles 4.8%, to $347.09. MRA\u2019s Mayank Seksaria notes that momentum is still getting clobbered, and that value\u2019s outperformance\u2014what there is of it\u2014is not because investors suddenly like cheap stocks. The iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) has dropped 2.2%, to $110.19, while the iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) has fallen 1.7%, to $83.44. \u201cThe seeming rotation from Momentum to Value, is more likely a function of the fact that the longs in the Momentum factor and shorts in the Value factor are highly correlated,\u201d he explains.

        "content": "BEIJING\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% apologized over the hacking of some Chinese accounts in phishing scams, almost a week after it emerged that stolen Apple IDs had been used to swipe customer funds. In its English statement Tuesday, Apple said it found \u201ca small number of our users\u2019 accounts\u201d had been accessed through phishing scams. \u201cWe are deeply apologetic about the inconvenience caused to our customers by these phishing scams,\u201d Apple said in its Chinese statement. The incident came to light last week when Chinese mobile-payment giants Alipay and WeChat TCEHY 2.04% Pay said some customers had lost money. The victims of the scams, Apple said Tuesday, hadn\u2019t enabled so-called two-factor authentication\u2014a setting that requires a user to log in with a password and a freshly-generated code to verify their identity. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company didn\u2019t specify how many users were hit or how much money was stolen, nor did it offer details about how the hackers acquired the users\u2019 Apple IDs and passwords. To help prevent unauthorized access to their accounts, Apple said, people should enable two-factor authentication. An Apple ID refers to the account used to access Apple services such as its App Store and iCloud. It includes information such as the user\u2019s email address, password and payment details, according to Apple\u2019s website. China is a key market for Apple and the fraud is the latest challenge it is facing in an area where its share of the smartphone market has been treading water. As the U.S.-China trade battle escalates, Apple is particularly exposed\u2014most of its products are assembled in China. Still, it has so far avoided a major hit and there have been no signs of boycotts of American goods, though some major U.S. brands are vulnerable should tensions ramp up. The hacking incident received broad media coverage in China, including detailed reports by state broadcaster CCTV that included victims saying they lost money to App Store purchases they didn\u2019t make. The broadcaster urged the companies to be more responsive. Many consumers in China connect their Apple accounts to online-payment systems, including those run by Alipay, the payments affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , and WeChat TCEHY 2.04% Pay, owned by rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. A spokesman for Alipay, owned by Ant Financial Services Group, said the company had no additional comments beyond the previous online warning. Tencent didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple has come under recent scrutiny in China over its approach to data privacy and security. In February, Apple started shifting the iCloud accounts of its China-based customers to the servers of a state-owned local partner, a move made to comply with Chinese law. It has also said it would store the encryption keys for those accounts in a secure location in China while retaining control over them. \u2014Yang Jie in Beijing and Stella Yifan Xie in Hong Kong contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% has agreed to bring in house more than 300 engineers from one of its key suppliers, Europe-based Dialog Semiconductor DLG 0.47% PLC, as part of a $600 million deal that boosts the smartphone giant\u2019s chip-design operations. The transfer of what amounts to 16% of Dialog\u2019s total workforce involves a group of engineers who have already been supporting Apple\u2019s chip development, Dialog said Thursday. Apple will pay Dialog $300 million in cash and prepay $300 million for Dialog products to be delivered over the next three years. As part of the deal, Apple will also assume control of certain Dialog facilities in Italy, Germany and the U.K. The company\u2019s headquarters are in the U.K., though the bulk of its revenue is generated in Germany. Buying up assets and key personnel isn\u2019t unusual in the tech industry as a way to bring supply lines or promising new technology into the fold. Still, the Dialog deal stands out for Apple, whose largest-ever acquisition\u2014its $3 billion deal in 2014 for Beats Electronics\u2014entailed the addition of about 700 people. Apple\u2019s talent acquisition comes at a time when the development of more powerful processors for the iPhone is outpacing advances in the device\u2019s battery. Apple has been using Dialog chips to manage the battery life of its iPhones for years, but more recently has added its own semiconductor experts to design chips that work alongside Dialog\u2019s components to optimize power, according to a person familiar with the matter. That in-house design initiative has cut into Dialog\u2019s business. The company counted on Apple for about 70% to 80% of its revenue, or about $3 an iPhone, until Apple began developing some of its own power-management chips, according to UBS. Dialog\u2019s shares tumbled earlier this year when the company disclosed that Apple also was adding a second power-management chip supplier. On Thursday, they rose 25% to \u20ac20.79 ($24.11) in Frankfurt trading. As part of Thursday\u2019s deal, Dialog said it had been given new contracts for the development and supply of power-management, audio subsystems, charging and other mixed-signal integrated circuits for Apple\u2019s products. It expects to start generating revenue from those contracts next year. \u201cThere has been a lot of speculation over our relationship with Apple,\u201d Dialog Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli said in an interview. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t been done with any other suppliers in terms of Apple investing and licensing the technology and also doing prepay at the same time. It is sending a very strong signal of partnership to the market.\u201d Mr. Bagherli said Dialog supplies chips in almost everything Apple has to offer and that it would now seek to win more work on peripheral products. \u201cOur relationship with Dialog goes all the way back to the early iPhones, and we look forward to continuing this longstanding relationship with them,\u201d said Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of hardware technologies. Dialog plans to use the proceeds from the Apple deal to accelerate investments in growth opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions. It expects the transaction to be concluded in the first half of 2019. \u201cIn some way this is lifesaving for Dialog because it strongly decreases all the uncertainty in the market for Dialog stock,\u201d said Robin Brass, an analyst at Hauck & Aufh\u00e4user Investment Banking. \u201cNo one knew what was going to happen with Apple.\u201d",

        "content": "4 p.m. It\u2019s ugly out there. The S&P 500 dropped 94.66 points, or 3.29%, to 2785.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 831.83 points, or 3.15%, to 25598.74. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 315.97 points, or 4.08%, to 7422.05, its largest one-day percentage decline since June 24, 2016. If you pay attention to the headlines, the weakness appears to be driven by the ratcheting up of tensions between the U.S. and China. But the major market indexes tell a more complicated story. The S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index has dropped 4.8%, making it the hardest hit sector in the benchmark, and continuing a recent trend. (It means that health care has pulled ahead of tech in terms of 2018 performance.) It isn\u2019t just tech, though, as all the FAANGs got walloped despite being in three different sectors now. Apple (AAPL) declined 4.6% to $216.36, Facebook (FB) fell 4.2% to $151.38, Netflix (NFLX) slumped 8.3% to $325.89, Amazon.com (AMZN) dropped 6.2% to $1,748.01, and Alphabet (GOOGL) is off 4.6% at $1,090.89. But even some sectors that could be benefiting are getting hit. The S&P 500 Industrials Sector Index has slumped 3.5%, implying that investors are concerned about growth. The S&P 500 Utilities Index ended down 0.5% but managed to spend much of the day in positive territory, a sign that investors are just plain scared. \u201cThe bottom line is that among the sector bifurcation, the Small Cap unwind, the surge in rates and the spiking U.S. Dollar (all of which we\u2019ve touched on lately), there is plenty to push the \u2018market\u2019 around,\u201d writes Instinet\u2019s Frank Cappelleri.

        "content": "Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 3.42% accused Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% of funneling proprietary information about the chip supplier\u2019s technology to rival Intel Corp. INTC 0.85% , broadening a long-running legal battle between two companies central to the smartphone industry. Apple engineers used its software and confidential files to help Intel engineers develop modem chips for iPhones, according to an amended complaint Qualcomm filed Tuesday in California\u2019s Superior Court in San Diego County. Qualcomm, which is seeking unspecified damages, provided no evidence supporting its charges in the filing. It is asking the court for a jury trial where it said it would present evidence based in part on discovery it\u2019s already conducted. An Apple spokesman referred to the company\u2019s past statement on Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, calling them illegal and harmful to the smartphone industry. Intel, which isn\u2019t named as a defendant, declined to comment. Its modem chips were incorporated into iPhones in 2016, marking an end to a period of Qualcomm exclusivity as a supplier of that component. \u201c Apple has engaged in a yearslong campaign of false promises, stealth, and subterfuge designed to steal Qualcomm\u2019s confidential information. \u201d The accusation of intellectual-property theft intensifies the feud between Apple and Qualcomm and lessens the likelihood of a settlement between the two in the near future. The longtime technology partners are locked in legal tussles over patent royalties and patent infringements in courts ranging from the U.S. to Germany. That dispute has upended a partnership that dates back to 2010, when Qualcomm entered an agreement to begin supplying Apple with modem chips for iPhones and iPads. Apple first sued Qualcomm in January 2017 over the modem supplier\u2019s practice of collecting royalties on the entire sales price of an iPhone up to $400. Qualcomm says it charges a percentage of an entire device because its patents\u2014essential to implementing cellular-communication standards\u2014relate to cellular devices as a whole, not just its chips. Under terms of their previous partnership, Qualcomm said it agreed to provide Apple with techniques, methods and software to evaluate the performance of its modems in iPhones. Those agreements gave a limited number of Apple engineers access to sensitive information, and Qualcomm said it has evidence showing Apple provided some of that information to Intel around 2016\u2014a time when it says the iPhone maker was seeking leverage in modem-chip negotiations. \u201cApple has engaged in a yearslong campaign of false promises, stealth, and subterfuge designed to steal Qualcomm\u2019s confidential information,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing. The allegations are an amendment to a breach of contract suit Qualcomm filed last November. In it, Qualcomm accused Apple of violating an agreement that allows the chip supplier to audit the iPhone maker\u2019s use of its software. Qualcomm also said Apple engineers had shared some information about its technology with other Apple engineers working on competitors\u2019 chips. In August, Apple challenged Qualcomm\u2019s suit in a filing, saying that after nine months of discovery the chip maker had failed to disclose evidence supporting those allegations. It asked the court to compel Qualcomm to disclose evidence. Qualcomm\u2019s filing Tuesday expands on the chip supplier\u2019s prior claims by directly accusing Apple of using Qualcomm software to improve Intel\u2019s chip performance. It also says Intel engineers complained to Apple they weren\u2019t able to open Qualcomm files provided by the iPhone maker. The latest legal volley from Qualcomm lands the same month as Apple announced new iPhones without Qualcomm modem chips. The iPhone XS and XS Max released last week rely on modem chips from Intel, according to iFixit, a site that evaluates the components in new devices. The legal fight with Apple has hung over Qualcomm throughout a difficult period. The company fought off a takeover from Broadcom Inc. in March. It later abandoned its own planned takeover of NXP Semiconductors NV because it couldn\u2019t secure regulatory approval from China due to the trade battle with the U.S. Apple has withheld billions of dollars in payments as the royalty dispute marches on.",

        "content": "Last December\u2019s tax overhaul is boosting corporate profits in more ways than one. The legislation lowered companies\u2019 tax bills, improving their earnings. But the change has also helped them fund record stock buybacks\u2014a move that makes their results appear even better, by boosting the per-share earnings they highlight for investors. S&P 500 companies bought back a record $189 billion of their own shares in the first quarter, and a similar number\u2014if not more\u2014is expected for the second quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. By contrast, S&P 500 buybacks totaled no more than $137 billion in any of the six quarters before the tax overhaul. Stock buybacks make profits appear better by boosting per-share earnings, a metric investors frequently use to justify a company\u2019s stock price. Buybacks reduce a company\u2019s share count, spreading the profits across fewer shares. As a result, companies can report a bigger percentage increase in per-share earnings than the profit results alone may show. Among the more aggressive companies in buying back stock, Apple Inc. repurchased 112.8 million shares in the quarter that ended in June, contributing 5 cents to its earnings of $2.34 a share. Union Pacific Corp. repurchased about 4% of its shares in the second quarter, helping earnings per share climb substantially faster than net income. Thanks to buybacks, Southwest Airlines Co. \u2019s quarterly per-share earnings rose even though its profit fell from a year earlier. For the S&P 500, per-share earnings in the second quarter rose about 25% from a year ago\u2014a full 2 percentage points faster than net income, according to data from Thomson Reuters. \u201cIt would be fair to assume it is all from buybacks,\u201d said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters. The higher per-share earnings have helped lead investors to pay more for stocks. The S&P 500 index is trading at record highs after gaining about 10% this year. \u201cInvestors need to realize what they\u2019re paying a premium for,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. In all, dozens of large companies bought back 4% or more of their shares outstanding in the 12 months ended in June, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. The resulting boosts to earnings might seem small in any given quarter, but they add up\u2014Apple\u2019s buybacks also added 8 cents a share in the March quarter, for instance. And companies also have started big new buyback programs, suggesting earnings-per-share increases will continue. The buybacks aren\u2019t necessarily done for the express purpose of increasing per-share earnings. Many companies say they want to return excess capital to shareholders. Others intend to offset new shares issued to employees as compensation. The per-share earnings increases generated by stock buybacks are low quality, inflating results without underlying substance, said Gregory Milano, chief executive of Fortuna Advisors, a financial consulting firm that has examined buyback trends. \u201cIt has less value.\u201d Companies play down the buyback effect. They say their earnings are strong even without buybacks, and that while the buybacks add to per-share earnings, the effect is clear to investors and baked into the analyst earnings estimates that drive stock prices. Apple pointed to its past statements that its earnings growth is accelerating and that tax overhaul \u201cenables us to deploy our global cash more efficiently,\u201d leading it to put forward plans to create 20,000 U.S. jobs and invest $350 billion in U.S. operations over the next five years. Union Pacific\u2019s buybacks contributed 9 cents to its second-quarter per-share earnings, helping that metric to climb 37%, while net income rose 29% from a year ago. The railroad\u2019s finance chief, Robert Knight, said the buybacks \u201crepresent the return of excess cash to our shareholders and are consistent with guidance we provided to the financial-analyst community.\u201d Southwest Airlines\u2019 second-quarter net income excluding items declined 2.1% from a year ago. On a per-share basis, however, it rose 2.4%, in part because the company has repurchased 28.3 million shares in the past year. Southwest said its per-share earnings growth \u201chas been driven primarily by the strong financial performance of our robust network.\u201d As the economic cycle grinds on, Mr. Milano said, companies may find it harder to show earnings growth even as they face increased pressure from shareholders to do so--\u201cand so buybacks start to look more attractive.\u201d The buyback effect adds to the earnings boost companies are already seeing because the U.S. cut its corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Union Pacific\u2019s second-quarter effective rate, for example, declined to 22.1% from 37.5% a year ago, before the tax overhaul. At some companies, the tax cut has accounted for half or more of reported profits. The benefits to per-share earnings from buybacks can help a company\u2019s result compare more favorably to Wall Street forecasts. In each of the past two quarters, big buybacks by Cisco Systems Inc. increased its adjusted per-share earnings by 2 cents. Each time, the networking giant\u2019s total results surpassed analysts\u2019 consensus expectations by a penny. Cisco said its buybacks are incorporated into the earnings per share guidance it provides to analysts. \u201cThis is not a quality of earnings issue, and it is inaccurate to state that we would have otherwise \u2019missed\u2019 EPS targets,\u201d a company representative said. Experts say when companies do guide analysts on their buyback plans, the effect on estimates is imprecise. For instance, buybacks earlier in a quarter make a bigger difference in per-share earnings, because such results are calculated using average shares outstanding. Companies, though, don\u2019t typically forecast the timing of buybacks. In the first quarter, just after the tax overhaul, a record 78% of S&P 500 companies reported earnings above analysts\u2019 expectations, according to FactSet. The second quarter then beat that record, with 80%.",

        "content": "Tim Cook sat down more than a year ago to watch Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s first scripted drama, \u201cVital Signs,\u201d and was troubled by what he saw. The show, a dark, semi-biographical tale of hip hop artist Dr. Dre, featured characters doing lines of cocaine, an extended orgy in a mansion and drawn guns. It\u2019s too violent, Mr. Cook told Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine, said people familiar with Apple\u2019s entertainment plans. Apple can\u2019t show this. Across Hollywood and inside Apple, the show has become emblematic of the challenges faced by the technology giant as it pushes into entertainment. Apple earmarked $1 billion for Hollywood programming last year. But in the tone CEO Mr. Cook has set for it, whatever Apple produces mustn\u2019t taint a pristine brand image that has helped the company collect 80% of the profits in the global smartphone market. Apple\u2019s entertainment team must walk a line few in Hollywood would consider. Since Mr. Cook spiked \u201cVital Signs,\u201d Apple has made clear, say producers and agents, that it wants high-quality shows with stars and broad appeal, but it doesn\u2019t want gratuitous sex, profanity or violence. The result is an approach out of step with the triumphs of the video-streaming era. Other platforms, such as HBO and Amazon.com Inc., have made their mark in original content with edgier programming that often wins critical acclaim. Netflix Inc., which helped birth the streaming revolution, built its original-content business on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a drama about an ethically bankrupt politician, and \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d a comedic drama about a women\u2019s prison. Both feature rough language and plenty of sex. As a consumer-product company, Apple is especially exposed if content strikes a sour note, said Preston Beckman, a former NBC and Fox programming executive. For Netflix, the only risk is that people don\u2019t subscribe, he said. \u201cWith Apple, you can say, \u2018I\u2019m going to punish them by not buying their phone or computer.\u2019 \" Apple has twice postponed the launch of its first slate of shows, moving it to March from late this year, agents and producers said. One leading producer with projects at Apple expects the date to be pushed back yet further. Hollywood routinely humbles big companies that try to join its club. In 2014, Microsoft Corp. closed its Hollywood unit, Xbox Entertainment Studios, before it got off the ground. Coca-Cola Co. , which owned Columbia Pictures in the 1980s, found its success with \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cStand by Me\u201d was outweighed by expensive flops such as \u201cIshtar.\u201d Entertainment is \u201cirrational and unpredictable,\u201d said Peter Sealey, a consultant who led marketing for Coke\u2019s Hollywood business. Apple excels at devices and Coke at soft drinks, he said, but \u201cmovies and TV are none of that. They\u2019re emotional.\u201d Mr. Cook told analysts in July that Apple wasn\u2019t ready to detail its Hollywood plans, but he felt \u201creally good about what we will eventually offer.\u201d The company didn\u2019t make executives available for interviews for this article. Hollywood is central to Apple\u2019s strategy. As growth slows in the number of iPhones sold, Apple is trying to accelerate its services business, which includes the App Store, mobile payments and entertainment, including its music-subscription offering. It wants shows to support a video service on its TV app that could be bundled with subscriptions such as iCloud storage, said the people familiar with Apple\u2019s entertainment plans. Apple\u2019s arrival coincides with upheaval in Hollywood. Declining pay-TV subscriptions and the rise of Netflix have set off an entertainment land grab. Tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook Inc. are offering video services to deepen ties with existing customers. Traditional media and telecom companies are trying to fend them off with mergers, such as Walt Disney Co. \u2019s deal for 21st Century Fox Inc. assets and AT&T Inc. \u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The tumult has fueled an explosion in the number of scripted shows, to 487 last year, up more than two-thirds in five years. There is a rush to sign up top show creators, as in Warner Bros.\u2019s $300 million long-term deal to keep prolific producer Greg Berlanti. Apple has bought more than a dozen shows, favoring broadly appealing, family-friendly fare. They include a series about poet Emily Dickinson and a \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d-style drama about basketball star Kevin Durant. Apple signed partnerships with Oprah Winfrey, perhaps entertainment\u2019s most wholesome star, and Sesame Workshop, the producers of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d Of roughly two-dozen shows Apple has in development or production, only a few could veer into \u201cTV-MA\u201d territory, television\u2019s equivalent of R-rated films. Apple\u2019s sensitivity affects how its top Hollywood executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, approach their jobs. The duo, who previously shepherded \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d at Sony Pictures, devote considerable time to winning a nod for shows from Mr. Cook and Eddy Cue, a senior vice president who oversees services, said someone well-versed in company dynamics. Messrs. Van Amburg and Erlicht have successfully pushed some edgier shows. Apple signed a deal for a series made by M. Night Shyamalan about a couple who lose a young child. Before saying yes to that psychological thriller, Apple executives had a request: Please eliminate the crucifixes in the couple\u2019s house, said people working on the project. They said executives made clear they didn\u2019t want shows that venture into religious subjects or politics. Mr. Shyamalan wasn\u2019t available for comment. Not every moviemaker has found Apple imposing boundaries. Early work on a comedy called \u201cLittle America\u201d with Kumail Nanjiani \u201cfeels like a typical development process,\u201d said co-producer Lee Eisenberg. And graphic content certainly isn\u2019t the only path to success in TV and streaming. There\u2019s little or none in some of Netflix\u2019s hits, such as \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and in some popular broadcast-TV shows such as \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d Still, there\u2019s no shying away from nudity, politics and raw language at cable networks such as FX, TNT, HBO and Showtime or at Netflix and Amazon Prime. Even Disney, which built its business on animated films for children, is bringing R-rated content like the raunchy \u201cDeadpool\u201d superhero films into its fold with its pending 21st Century Fox acquisition. Where Apple draws the line isn\u2019t clear, say producers, agents and writers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure myself what they\u2019re after,\u201d said producer Shawn Ryan, whose credits include the FX hit \u201dThe Shield.\u201d \u201cI do adore Zack and Jamie and trust in their taste. I think we\u2019re all curious to see what it\u2019s going to be.\" Apple is making big commitments to win projects. It outbid Netflix and CBS Corp. \u2019s Showtime to land a drama about a morning news show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, ordering two seasons and skipping the usual requirement of a pilot episode. The show\u2019s price could top $12 million an episode, according to people familiar with it. Apple\u2019s venture entails behind-the-scenes drama unusual for the tech company\u2019s typically regimented operations. Apple replaced the person in charge of the Aniston-Witherspoon show, known as the showrunner, before filming. The executive producer\u2019s inexperience was an issue, but Apple also wanted a more upbeat show and took exception to some of the humor proposed, according to people working on the project. The show now is delayed and is having scheduling issues with Ms. Witherspoon, who has other commitments, they said. Apple also replaced showrunners for a reboot of Steven Spielberg\u2019s anthology \"Amazing Stories,\u201d finding the original team\u2019s vision a little dark, said people familiar with that project. Apple\u2019s handful of TV-MA projects include \u201cShantaram,\u201d about a former heroin addict who smuggles guns to Afghanistan, and a potential show about the late pop star George Michael. Mr. Cook, better known for memorizing spreadsheets and detailing supply costs, makes an unlikely Hollywood kingpin. His favorite TV shows are relatively tame fare such as \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and \u201cMadame Secretary,\u201d say people he has spoken with about it. Mr. Cue acts as Hollywood translator. He made his mark leading Apple\u2019s iTunes business with a tough negotiating style that cemented the 99-cent price for songs. Mr. Cue has said shows he enjoys include HBO\u2019s violent and sex-filled \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and the sci-fi \u201cWestworld.\u201d The two men started exploring a video-programming strategy almost three years ago. With investors calling for Apple to buy Netflix, and Apple\u2019s effort to launch a bundle of cable channels foundering, the executives invited in Hollywood executives such as Creative Artists Agency people and award-winning producer Brian Grazer, said people involved in the discussions. Apple wanted to know about how the business works, who was doing well and why. Apple discussed with CAA afterward a confidential initiative to procure and develop programming for its app store, according to these people. They said the talent agency secured funding for the effort and scooped up several projects, including a Keanu Reeves show about a hit man and a risqu\u00e9 Michael Fassbender show about a rally-car driver. Apple Music pursued projects of its own. The division, built partly through the $3 billion 2014 acquisition of Beats Electronics LLC, was led by Mr. Iovine, who figured video would differentiate Apple\u2019s streaming-music service. In addition to the ill-fated \u201cVital Signs\u201d project with Beats co-founder and Apple executive Dr. Dre, Mr. Iovine worked on a show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and partnered with CBS on \u201cCarpool Karaoke.\u201d Some content on both shows, which now are available on Apple Music, originally troubled Apple brass. The company edited out \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d segments with swearing, frustrating stars of the show, said a person familiar with the editing. In \u201cCarpool Karaoke,\u201d which won an Emmy this week, Apple sanitized comedian James Corden\u2019s faux outrage in the first episode so the audience hears \u201cWhat the [bleep]?\u201d As Apple Music\u2019s video efforts struggled, Mr. Cue charted a new course, hiring Messrs. Van Amburg and Erlicht from Sony, where they had built a reputation for creative chops and business savvy. The mandate was to build a slate of original shows. The duo visited talent agencies last fall encouraging agents to bring them quality ideas. One agent described the message as: \u201cDon\u2019t edit yourselves. We\u2019re Apple, and we\u2019re going to take big swings.\u201d Agents soon began to question that, as Apple started signing up series with the broad appeal of network shows and ended discussions over the grittier projects starring Mr. Fassbender and Mr. Reeves, according to people familiar with those projects. Messrs. Van Amburg and Erlicht amended their message, saying Apple was open to anything and everything so long as there was no gratuitous violence or nudity, according to talent-agency people. One agent said some members of Apple\u2019s team in Los Angeles began calling themselves \u201cexpensive NBC.\u201d Recently, Apple initially expressed interest when it was pitched a politically charged show about a college ombudsman in the era of #MeToo, featuring comedian Whitney Cummings and the producer behind the Fox hit \u201cEmpire,\u201d Lee Daniels. Apple subsequently sent word there was concern about the sensitive topics, and the sides had differing opinions on the show\u2019s direction. The show is now in talks to end up at Amazon.",

        "content": "Two of the newest iPhones hit stores Friday, with predictable scenes of customers around the world lining up outside Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% stores and the decade-old guessing game over how strong demand will be for the technology giant\u2019s latest gadgets. Sales of the iPhone XS and XS Max, unveiled Sept. 12, began Friday at 8 a.m. at Apple\u2019s Sydney store and continue across Asia, Europe and the Americas. Customer turnout will go a long way toward determining Apple\u2019s results over the next year. Though iPhone unit sales have stagnated, the company has delivered record revenue by increasing prices. It has extended that strategy this fall, jacking up the price of the top-end XS Max model to $1,099 from $999. The new handsets, which feature Apple\u2019s largest screens ever, as well as faster processors and improved batteries, are designed to encourage upgrades from older devices by nearly 500 million customers analysts estimate are using iPhones two-years old or older. \u201cIf we get a lot of people with older phones showing up, that\u2019s a good sign,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at investment and research firm Loup Ventures. Lines at Apple\u2019s Fifth Avenue store in New York slightly exceeded turnout for the iPhone 8 a year ago but were about half as long as lines for the November release of the iPhone X, according to Loup, which surveyed customers at five stores. In San Francisco, 29-year-old Daniel Durkee said he skipped upgrading to a new iPhone last year because he wanted a larger phone. \u201cI even wish they could make it a little bit bigger,\u201d Mr. Durkee said of the 6.5-inch XS Max he bought to replace his iPhone 7 Plus. Many people turning out were part of Apple\u2019s upgrade program, which allowed them to switch from an iPhone X to the XS Max while increasing their monthly fee to $54.08 from $49.91. \u201cI had an iPhone Plus before and wanted to go back to a bigger one,\u201d said David Nguyen, 30, of San Francisco. Also hitting stores Friday is the company\u2019s latest smartwatch. The Series 4 watch is the first to receive clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to perform an electrocardiogram and measure a heart\u2019s electrical activity. Apple has said that feature will be added later through a software update. Those features sold William Mougayar on trading his Fitbit for an Apple Watch for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this,\u201d Mr. Mougayar, who was visiting San Francisco from Toronto, said of the new heart-monitoring capabilities. About one in every 15 customers on the first day of iPhone sales intended to buy a watch, said Mr. Munster, whose firm assesses demand annually at about five stores. Buyers preparing to drop as much as $1,099 on a new device need all the information they can get. Here are The Wall Street Journal\u2019s guides to Apple\u2019s new devices and features this year. The new iPhone XS and XS Max are great phones but the XR, due out in October, sounds more like a great deal. It really comes down to what you want and how much you want to spend. Here are the basic differences: \u2022 iPhone XS: An upgrade to the 5.8-inch iPhone X from last year, with a vibrant, edge-to-edge OLED screen and two cameras on the back. It still starts at $1,000. (The original X is gone. RIP.) \u2022 iPhone XS Max: A giant version of the XS with a 6.5-inch screen\u2014Apple\u2019s biggest-ever phone display. It starts at $1,049. \u2022 iPhone XR: A new model that doesn\u2019t have the rear two cameras or OLED display, but does have a large 6.1-inch LCD screen and apparently better battery life. It starts at $749, but you can\u2019t get it until Oct. 26. The upshot: Choose which iPhone features matter to you most, ignore Apple\u2019s time frame and make your decision from there. \u2014Joanna Stern Apple\u2019s most important upgrade this fall doesn\u2019t cost $1,000, and you don\u2019t have to go to the Apple Store to get it. In fact, after testing iOS 12\u2014the latest version of the software that powers iPhones and iPads\u2014a lot of people can skip buying a new phone altogether. The new OS is available for download now to all devices that were able to run iOS 11. That means every iPhone since the 5s and every iPad since the Mini 2. (If you\u2019re using a device older than those, it\u2019s truly time for a new one.) The best thing about iOS 12 is how well it runs on older gadgets. And some of iOS 12\u2019s features, such as an improved Do Not Disturb mode and Screen Time feature (more on that below), may even improve your relationship with devices by helping you to use them less. \u2014David Pierce Screen Time provides charts and graphs about your daily and weekly usage: how often you picked up the phone, how long you spent in certain apps, etc. It\u2019s not an app\u2014it\u2019s hidden in Settings. The feature is based on the idea that if you\u2019re aware of how much time you spend on your devices, you\u2019ll do it less. It presents loads of information about your usage, and you can set time limits on specific apps so you\u2019re locked out of them. Just one little problem: For those of us who compulsively check our phones\u2014sometimes even when watching our children on the playground, or crossing the street\u2014Apple\u2019s lock is like Scotch tape on a pack of cigarettes. It\u2019s too easy to ignore the limitations you set. If you\u2019re not super addicted, though, there\u2019s hope. Here\u2019s how it all works. \u2014Joanna Stern It has never been exactly clear why the Apple Watch exists. It does a lot of things, certainly: delivers notifications, tracks fitness, makes phone calls, helps you pay for stuff and lots more besides. Your phone does all of those same things just fine, though, so why spend hundreds more on yet another gadget you need to charge all the time? With the new $399-and-up Apple Watch Series 4, Apple offers the most compelling thing yet for the Watch to do what the iPhone can\u2019t: help you monitor and track your health in deep, medically useful ways. \u2014David Pierce",

        "content": "For the second straight year, Apple AAPL 0.85% is starting to sell its new iPhones at different times\u2014but this time, the company is putting its priciest models first. Last year\u2019s release of the high-end iPhone X came six weeks after Apple\u2019s other two new, less expensive smartphones because of what The Wall Street Journal and others reported were production delays involving its advanced organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen. This year, according to people familiar with Apple\u2019s production plans, the company prioritized production of its two pricier OLED models, the iPhone XS and XS Max, whose prices start at about $1,000. Both will hit stores Friday, followed five weeks later by the least expensive new model, the XR, which has an LCD screen and a starting price of $749. The staggered release gives Apple a month to sell the higher-end models without cheaper competition from itself. It also simplifies logistics and retail demands and could strengthen Apple\u2019s ability to forecast sales and production of all three models through the Christmas holidays, analysts and supply chain experts said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a Dutch auction,\u201d said Josh Lowitz, co-founder of research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, referring to the practice of starting with a high asking price, then lowering it until a buyer accepts. \u201cThe people who are most committed will pay to get early access. Then you get to the people who are making a choice and may settle for the $750 phone. This could become the new normal.\u201d An Apple spokeswoman said the company releases its products when they are ready. Until last year, Apple had launched a maximum of two new iPhones annually. It launched three last year, while increasing prices: the iPhone X, which cost nearly $1,000 and was the first to jettison a home button and to add facial-recognition technology; and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which featured the traditional home button and started at $699. Apple put the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus on sale last September but delayed the release of the iPhone X until November because of the production issues\u2014marking the first time Apple had released multiple flagship iPhones at different times. That approach damped sales of the iPhone 8 models because many customers waited until the iPhone X was released. This year, Apple is taking a different tack. The company and its suppliers have started ramping up mass production of the iPhone XS models earlier than the iPhone XR model, the people familiar with production plans said. The company also began planning for the LCD model after the OLED model, the people said. The phones have significantly different features. The iPhone XS models feature screen sizes of 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches, and both have 3D touch capabilities and dual-camera systems. Meanwhile, the 6.1-inch iPhone XR model features haptic touch and a single, rear camera. OLED screens are thinner, don\u2019t need backlight and offer greater contrast than traditional liquid-crystal display, or LCD, screens. The OLED displays in the XS are also more expensive than the LCD screens in the XR, contributing to the different prices, analysts say. Still, the OLED models are likely to be far more profitable for Apple. The XR is estimated to cost $331 to build, while the XS and XS Max are estimated to cost $355 and $371, according to Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst with trading firm Susquehanna International Group\u2014much narrower gaps than their corresponding retail prices. Apple expects to sell more iPhone XR than iPhone XS or XS Max models, analysts say. The company has ordered production of 38 million iPhone XR, 32 million iPhone XS Max and 13 million iPhone XS devices, according to UBS. It also will sell older LCD models, including the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. With Apple prioritizing the higher-end phones to start, and giving the XR a price tag $50 higher than last year\u2019s least expensive new model, several analysts estimate Apple will increase its average selling prices by about 6% over the next fiscal year. \u201cFor that price point, they\u2019re going to sell a lot of XRs,\u201d said UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri. In addition to giving Apple a chance to assess early demand for the iPhone XR, the staggered shipments give Apple a chance to simplify stocking and in-store promotion for retail partners like Best Buy Co. and AT&T Inc., said supply-chain consultant John Haber of Spend Management Experts. That could allow retailers to spend September and October promoting the higher-priced models before shifting to the lower-priced iPhone XR ahead of Black Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to have everything great for one release, but three new releases is very complex,\u201d Mr. Haber said. \u201cYou\u2019re relying a lot on retail stores to handle logistics.\u201d \u2014Yang Jie contributed to this article.",

Share repurchases can play a role in boosting stock prices because they lower the number of shares outstanding\u2014driving up per-share earnings even without overall profit growth. Company demand can also trigger stock-price gains. Analysts have said record stock buybacks have underpinned recent market advances, helping major indexes stay near all-time highs despite ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and a rout in emerging markets. Historically, companies used the most cash on capital expenditures\u2014spending on factories, equipment and other goods. However, in the first half of the year, share buybacks increased nearly 50% and approved repurchases are on pace to set a new full-year record above $1 trillion, Goldman said. That is why the imminent blackout period for buybacks injects uncertainty for investors and traders. Returns from the S&P 500 during blackout and nonblackout periods have been roughly in line going back to 2000, but market volatility tends to be higher when buybacks aren\u2019t allowed, the Goldman Sachs analysts found. The current blackout period comes during another remarkably placid period for U.S. stocks. The Cboe Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the S&P 500, has dropped in five of the last six sessions and remains near historically low levels. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gone 59 trading days without a move of 1% in either direction, the longest streak since January, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It is also only the fifth time in the past five years the measure has posted a such a streak for longer than 50 sessions. Consistent corporate profits coupled with robust economic growth has placated investors. Analysts estimate third-quarter earnings by companies in the S&P 500 will increase by 20% from a year earlier. That would be the third-fastest quarterly growth rate ever, trailing only the two previous quarters, according to FactSet. And the U.S. economy expanded at a revised rate of 4.2% in the second quarter, the quickest pace in nearly four years. Because major indexes have been unusually calm lately, sudden outsize market moves during the blackout period could sour investor sentiment toward stocks, some analysts say. That occurred when the market tumbled in February. With roughly 20% of the S&P 500 already unable to buy back shares, the U.S. announced new tariffs on about $200 billion in Chinese goods late Monday. Beijing responded with duties on $60 billion of U.S. products. The stock market actually rose after news of the new levies this week, as the tariffs taking effect later this month were less stringent than many investors had feared. But some analysts expect trade anxiety to build ahead of planned November meetings between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Both countries have laid out plans to end their monthslong tariff fight before those meetings. And next week, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates and update its projected path for future increases, potentially stoking fears that tighter financial conditions could challenge companies and consumers. Some analysts aren\u2019t as concerned about the blackout period because almost 80% of the growth in buybacks has been concentrated in 10 companies, most notably Apple, which itself has driven nearly a quarter of the increase in share repurchases this year. But after weeks of a quiet trading, others believe a quick pickup in volatility could cause investors to reassess the market backdrop. \u2014Michael Wursthorn contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Dear reader, I write to you with a serious iPhone review predicament. Imagine Goldilocks only tested the cold and hot porridges and never found the one that was \u201cjust right.\u201d Her life might have been entirely different. That\u2019s how I feel about testing the iPhone XS and XS Max\u2014without the iPhone XR\u2014for the past week. In case you missed it or just forgot, here are the basic differences: \u2022 iPhone XS: An upgrade to the 5.8-inch iPhone X from last year. It still starts at $1,000 and begins shipping Friday, Sept. 21. (The original X is gone. RIP.) \u2022 iPhone XS Max: A giant version of the XS with a 6.5-inch screen\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s biggest-ever phone display. It starts at $1,100 and also ships Friday. \u2022 iPhone XR: A new model that doesn\u2019t have the two-camera system and vibrant OLED screen, but does have a slightly larger 6.1-inch LCD screen and apparently better battery life. It starts at $750 and ships on Oct. 26. Sure, Apple\u2019s monthlong shipping gap might be a result of manufacturing timelines, or it might be a psychological trick to get you to buy the more expensive models out right now. Whatever the case, after in-depth testing of the new XS and XS Max models, I do have some direction for you. With subtle but strong improvements over last year\u2019s X, (subtle, that\u2019s what the S stands for, right?) the XS and XS Max are fabulous phones. But we\u2019ve hit a point where every smartphone is great\u2014it comes down to what you want and what you want to spend. Apple\u2019s free update revives old iPhones and iPads, and it makes Siri more useful, David Pierce says. With that, I present a choose-your-own-adventure iPhone XS and XS Max review. Choose which iPhone features matter to you most, ignore Apple\u2019s time frame and make your decision from there. If you want a ginormous screen on an iPhone, the XS Max\u2019s beautiful 6.5-inch OLED display is here for you. Surprisingly, the XS Max is about as large as the older iPhone Plus models\u2014its screen just covers more of the phone\u2019s face. The only way I could make the Max look small was to put it in the hand of Gheorghe Mure\u0219an, who shares the record for tallest basketball player in NBA history. (See my video review above.) Taking photos, watching videos, FaceTiming, Fortniting, even writing emails felt more immersive on the big phone. But two things hold me back from going to the Max. 1. Apple isn\u2019t doing enough to take advantage of all the extra space. The Max just feels like a blown-up iPhone, when it could be a new sort of computer. Unlike Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note or even Apple\u2019s iPad, you can\u2019t place apps side by side or float a video in the corner. 2. One-handed use is a struggle at times with smaller hands, especially typing\u2014even with Apple\u2019s \u201creachability\u201d trick that lets you shift the screen down when needed. The XS is more of a \u201cjust right\u201d fit for my hand and pocket. Even the XR felt much smaller than the Max. Both the XS and XS Max have what Apple says is \u201cthe most durable glass in the world.\u201d That said, my XS Max review unit cracked after a minor fall onto wood. All these glass slabs still need protection. The XS Max\u2019s battery life also makes it tempting. It generally lasted one to two hours longer during the day than my X. (As a heavy smartphone user\u2014yes, I\u2019m working on it\u2014I typically charge my X midafternoon to carry me till bedtime.) In my video streaming tests, the XS Max streamed Netflix for nearly 13 hours; the XS lasted 10.5 hours and the older X went just 9.5 hours. But the XR might outlast them all. According to claims on Apple\u2019s website, the XR will last 1.5 hours longer than the 8 Plus model\u2014and it\u2019s rated to have longer battery life than the XS Max when it comes to internet and video usage. I would also like to note that all these iPhones come with the same dinky 5W charger that\u2019s come with iPhones for the last 10 years. Use a faster charger, or else you\u2019ll wait hours for your fancy iPhone to juice up. If you are upgrading from any of the smaller iPhones of the past few years, the XS and XS Max cameras will be a big leap. (Both XS models have the new dual cameras.) If you\u2019re considering going from the X or the iPhone 8 Plus to the XS because of cameras, though, it\u2019s more of a mini hop. The neatest trick is the new advanced depth control in portrait mode. With this effect, you can simulate the artistic blur around your subject that photographers call bokeh. But I found that the phone still can\u2019t always get the blurring right around the edges of certain objects. The smart HDR feature and new sensors did make for a more even and clear photo when shooting almost directly into brighter lights\u2014plus crisper, more colorful low-light shots\u2014but overall my photos looked similar to the ones I\u2019ve taken with the X. In many cases, they were not as good as shots I\u2019ve taken with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or Google Pixel 2. What is noticeable? Autofocus and launching the camera on the XS models are speedier than on the X. Apple\u2019s new A12 Bionic processor also made augmented-reality apps on the XS feel less jittery. Everyday actions are faster, too\u2014even just pressing the reply button in the Gmail app. The XR will have the same processor. The Face ID system on the front of the phone was also faster and worked better in tough situations, like when I\u2019m lying in bed, but it still struggles with one pair of my sunglasses. (Luckily, iOS 12 lets you add a second face or look.) Oh, you\u2019d upgrade to the newest iPhone even if Apple only changed the color of the volume button? Don\u2019t worry, this is a judge-free zone. Still, unless you are in an iPhone upgrade program or absolutely dying for that Max screen, don\u2019t jump from the X to the XS. Going back to last year\u2019s model, I missed the speed boost a bit, but not enough to drop another grand or more. (That said, upgrading to iOS 12 will also speed up certain things, especially on older phones.) I realize this review may not have answered all your questions. Don\u2019t blame me, blame Apple\u2026and keep your wallet closed. See you in a month with the XR review. All the best, Joanna Write to Joanna Stern at joanna.stern@wsj.com",

        "content": "Womp Womp. It\u2019s the trade war\u2019s market; we\u2019re just living in it. Another round of threats from the White House sank hopes that we\u2019re on the cusp of a tariff agreement, and took the stock market with it. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we\u2026 A Case of the Mondays Stocks slumped across the board Monday, after China threatened to pull out of talks with the U.S. if another round of tariffs goes into effect\u2014and tech didn\u2019t help much. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 92.55 points, or 0.35%, to 26,062.12, while the S&P 500 slid 16.18 points, or 0.56%, to 2888.80 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 114.25 points, or 1.43%, to 7895.79. It\u2019s easy to understand what has markets so spooked: Investors were thrilled to hear that the U.S. and China were coming back to the table for talks, so if negotiations are canceled, we\u2019ll be that much closer to staring down the barrel at a full-blown trade war, which no one wants. Yes, the U.S. market has held up so far in the face of tariffs, unlike other markets, but \u201conly a fool would believe that the U.S. economy can withstand a protracted trade war,\u201d says Eaton Vance\u2019s Lew Piantedosi. Our economy has remained resilient so far, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine that continuing, given how interconnected the world is and how large, multinational companies rely on global trade, if both countries go nuclear. The administration surely knows this, and for a president who \u201changs his hat on how well the market does,\u201d it would be extremely undesirable to spark a selloff, especially ahead of the midterms. That leads Piantedosi to be confident that today\u2019s setback aside, an armistice isn\u2019t out of the question. A controlled descent is all the more desirable given that the market can\u2019t go up forever. While the U.S. \u201cremains the pacesetter of the global economic expansion as growth weakens elsewhere,\u201d FTSE Russell\u2019s Alec Young writes, it\u2019s not invincible. \u201cGlobal growth is downshifting,\u201d and most economists still expect gross domestic product to slow across most major regions next year, including the U.S. and China, \u201cthe two powerhouses behind nearly all global growth this past decade,\u201d Young continues. Yikes. At least we still have tech right? Well, not so much today, as the Nasdaq\u2019s decline demonstrated. Amazon.com (AMZN) is embroiled in a suspected data leak including bribe-taking employees, and concerns about the new iPhone and suppliers dinged Apple (AAPL). Well, Apple may have lost some shine, and while the FANGs\u2014 Facebook (FB), Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)\u2014may be gunning for its perch as the world\u2019s most valuable company, none has \u201cmanaged to create quite the same euphoria surrounding Apple in its prime,\u201d notes Leuthold\u2019s Kristen Perleberg. Like other giants of the S&P 500 before it, Apple will likely grizzle and fade, but fear not: A \u201cnew company [will] eventually ascertain this reputation (as history suggests it will).\u201d So FAANG, and maybe even tech in general, may eventually yield its crown as market leader, but another group will surely pick up its place and lead stocks higher. Who knows, maybe if we finally get a resolution on tariffs, it could be industrials, and CATBO\u2014Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA) will ride again. The Hot Stock Mosaic (MOS) soared to the top of the S&P 500 today for no apparent reason. Shares of Mosaic gained 3.9% to $31.99, the fertilizer makes highest in more than a month. Barron\u2019s recommended shares of fertilizer stocks on Aug. 18. The Biggest Loser Abiomed (ABMD) tumbled to the bottom of the S&P 500 today. Shares of Abiomed dropped 6.8% to $368.90, their second 6%-plus drop this month. Despite the drop, the medical-device maker\u2019s stock has still gained 97% in 2018.",

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif.\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% on Wednesday unveiled its biggest and most expensive iPhone lineup ever, making a bet that larger screens can persuade millions of iPhone owners to not only upgrade to a new device but also fork over more money than they spent in past years. A year removed from the 10th anniversary of a product that turned it into the world\u2019s most valuable company, Apple sought to enliven its flagship device with standard improvements like speedier processors and longer-lasting batteries while also touting innovative features like photo-editing tools and new haptic-touch technology. Apple bumped up the price of its highest end phone by $100 with the introduction of the $1,099 iPhone XS Max, a plus-size, 6.5-inch version of last year\u2019s anniversary model. The new iPhone XS, priced at $999, costs the same as last year\u2019s iPhone X and features the same 5.8-inch OLED display. And the iPhone XR is a 6.1-inch device with an edge-to-edge LCD display priced at $749, splitting the difference between last year\u2019s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus prices. The new models are critical to maintaining sales in a contracting smartphone market where people hold on to devices longer, and growth of high-price handsets has stagnated. The iPhone is Apple\u2019s most important product, accounting for about two-thirds of Apple\u2019s revenue, which totaled $53.3 billion last quarter. Though it became the first U.S. company to be valued at more than $1 trillion last month, tech rival Amazon.com Inc. more recently hit that milestone and is threatening to unseat the iPhone maker as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Apple average selling price, change from year earlier +15.4% with Q4 projection* 20% 15 10 5 0 \u20135 \u201914 \u201917 \u201915 FY2013 \u201916 \u201918 Market share of phones priced above $400 Huawei Apple Other Samsung 100% 80 60 40 20 0 \u201918 \u201917 \u201916 \u201919 2015 \u201920 FORECAST *Analyst forecast according to FactSet Note: Apple fiscal year ends September 29. Sources: the company (average selling price); IHS Markit (share) To maintain its corporate perch, Apple must squeeze more money out of its existing customers. The latest models have an average selling price of $949, 15% higher than the three phones launched a year ago. An estimated 254 million consumers use iPhones that are more than three years old and 486 million use iPhones that are more than two years old, according to Piper Jaffray, an asset-management firm. Apple is betting it can persuade enough customers to buy a new device to improve on the 17% increase in iPhone revenue that analysts predict it will deliver in the fiscal year ending in September, as the iPhone X\u2019s nearly $1,000 price tag offset flat unit sales. \u201cApple is having to run harder just to stand still,\u201d said Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s the classic sign of maturity.\u201d The iPhone remained the star at Wednesday\u2019s annual product showcase, which took place in the new Steve Jobs Theater at Apple\u2019s $5 billion campus. CEO Tim Cook and other executives focused solely on the iPhone and a new smartwatch, rather than introducing new versions of Mac computers, iPads or AirPod wireless headphones. Continuing the bigger-screen trend, Apple\u2019s new smartwatch has a 30% larger display than previous models. But the highlight of the Series 4 watch, starting at $399, is a new electrical sensor that gives the device electrocardiogram, or ECG, capabilities to measure a heart\u2019s electrical current in 30 seconds. It is the first of the company\u2019s smartwatches to win Food and Drug Administration clearance, showing the notoriously secretive company is willing to work with regulators as it pushes into the health industry. The new feature could help Apple elbow into the cardiac-monitoring market, valued at $1.4 billion, according to iRhythm Technologies Inc., which has an ECG product. Apple could reach a small percentage of that market while also bringing in some of the 15 million adults over 65 who have irregular heartbeats and don\u2019t know it. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a game changer for them,\u201d said Gene Mannheimer, an analyst at Dougherty & Co. who focuses on digital health. Apple is aiming to offset stagnant unit sales of iPhones with not only new products like the smartwatch but also from a fast-growing services business that includes app-store sales, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments. The services business jumped 26% to $27.2 billion over Apple\u2019s first three fiscal quarters through June. The bigger screens are expected to help that business line, as smartphone users with 6-inch screens or larger typically use twice as many apps as those with 5.5-inch screens and are twice as likely to watch video daily, according to Kantar Worldpanel. When Apple last introduced a major increase in display size with the iPhone 6 Plus in 2014, annual sales of the device the subsequent fiscal year soared 52% to $155.04 billion and shipments rose 37% to 231 million units. Few expect it to repeat that feat this year. The company this fiscal year will ship an estimated 151 million units of its three flagship models, flat with the two flagship models it shipped in fiscal 2015, according to estimates by Strategy Analytics, a technology research firm. Meanwhile, the complexity of making three models has reduced its iPhone operating margins to 30% this year from about 35% in 2015, the firm said.",

        "content": "New iPhones always come with a bit of confusion. They\u2019re still just black rectangles for texting messages, taking pics and listening to music, right? Here\u2019s the complete iPhone lineup, with special attention given to the differences between the new models. Photos may be slightly better, too, because of a new sensor and the A12 processor. However, the XS still has dual-12 megapixel cameras, both with optical image stabilizers, same as last year. Apple says the XS battery life will be about a half-hour longer than the iPhone X. Also: You can now get a model that goes up to 512GB of storage, where the previous X only went to 256GB. iPhone XS Max: Though it\u2019s mostly the same as the XS under the hood, the $1,099-and-up XS Max is noticeably different than last year\u2019s iPhone X because its OLED screen is a lot larger: 6.5 inches, measured diagonally. Because it has a bigger body, it can hold a bigger battery, which Apple says translates into an extra hour and a half on a charge. Both the XS and XS Max will have \u201cDual SIM\u201d support, so you can have two different wireless accounts on one phone\u2014for international travel, keeping a separate business line, etc. However, in markets other than China, there will still only be one physical SIM card slot. iPhone generations\u2019 screen sizes 6 6 inches iPhone XS Max 6.5-inch screen iPhone XR 5 5 6.1-inch screen iPhone X and XS 5.5-inch screen iPhone 6 Plus to 8 Plus 4 4 iPhone 6 to 8 4.7-inch screen 4.0-inch screen iPhone 5 to SE 3 3 Early iPhones 5.8-inch screen 2 2 3.5-inch screen 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 3 iPhone generations\u2019 screen sizes iPhone XS Max 6.5-inch screen 6 6 inches iPhone XR (6.1-inch screen) 5 5 iPhone X and XS iPhone 6 Plus to 8 Plus 5.5-inch screen 4 4 4.7-inch screen iPhone 6 to 8 iPhone 5 to SE 4.0-inch screen 3 3 Early iPhones 5.8-inch screen 2 2 3.5-inch screen 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 3 0 2 3 1 iPhone XS Max iPhone generations\u2019 screen sizes 6 6 inches 6.5-inch screen iPhone XR 5 5 6.1-inch screen iPhone X and XS 5.5-inch screen iPhone 6 Plus to 8 Plus 4 4 4.7-inch screen iPhone 6 to 8 iPhone 5 to SE 4.0-inch screen 3 3 Early iPhones 5.8-inch screen 2 2 3.5-inch screen 1 1 0 0 2 0 3 1 0 2 3 1 iPhone generations\u2019 screen sizes iPhone XS Max 6 6.5-inch screen iPhone XR 5 6.1-inch screen iPhone X and XS 4 3 2 5.8-inch screen 1 0 2 0 1 3 iPhone generations\u2019 screen sizes 6 inches 5 5.5-inch screen iPhone 6 Plus to 8 Plus 4 4.7-inch screen iPhone 6 to 8 4.0-inch screen iPhone 5 to SE 3 Early iPhones 2 3.5-inch screen 1 0 3 2 0 1 Note: Screens on iPhone X and more recent models have facial-recognition systems that cut into the display. Source: WSJ analysis of the phones Graphic by Stephanie Stamm iPhone XR: How could Apple build a phone with a fairly large edge-to-edge 6.1-inch screen but still charge a base price of $749? Instead of using OLED technology, which is known for high visual contrast, Apple used the LCD technology found in all iPhones before the iPhone X. The XR doesn\u2019t have the dual-rear cameras that first appeared on the iPhone 7 Plus. It has just one rear-facing 12-megapixel camera. But because the XR comes with the A12 Bionic chip, Apple was able to build in a portrait mode that lets you take pictures with artfully blurred backgrounds (a feature only available to dual-cam models before now). The iPhone XR will come in a selection of vibrant colors\u2014white, black, blue, yellow, coral and red\u2014while the XS and XS Max only come in gold, silver and space gray. Like the XS and XS Max\u2014and last year\u2019s iPhone X\u2014the XR has no home button. Instead, it uses front-facing cameras to recognize your face through Face ID, and uses different gestures to navigate the iOS interface. The XR also supports Dual Sim for multiple wireless accounts. All the new iPhones support wireless charging as well. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8: Apple no longer directly sells the iPhone X, iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and the iPhone SE. (You might be able to find them elsewhere.) It will, however, continue to sell models from the past two years\u20142016\u2019s iPhone 7 and larger 7 Plus, and last year\u2019s iPhone 8 and 8 Plus\u2014at reduced prices. These iPhones will be the last to have the Touch ID fingerprint reader, and displays that don\u2019t reach the top and bottom of the phone. The iPhone 8 models have the A11 Bionic chip, while the iPhone 7 models have the A10 Fusion chip\u2014both pretty powerful. Both of the larger Plus models have dual-rear cameras for optical zoom. The biggest difference between the iPhone 7 and 8 models is the latter supports wireless charging. This marks the first time all iPhones sold directly by Apple are water resistant\u2026and none have headphone jacks. Stay tuned for more analysis of the new iPhones.",

        "content": "The biggest news out of Apple\u2019s annual September extravaganza was, well, the biggest iPhone to date\u2014a model with a 6.5-inch screen called the iPhone XS Max. It\u2019s also the most expensive iPhone, for $1,099, cementing the company\u2019s recent strategy of raising the average selling price per smartphone. \u201cIt is the most advanced iPhone we have ever created,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook says. Apple (AAPL) has struggled to meet Wall Street expectations for iPhone unit shipments in recent quarters, but their average selling price has steadily increased to $739, according to Piper Jaffray and the company. Apple stock closed down 1.2%, to $221.07 on Wednesday. The stock typically ticks up in the days ahead of a product launch while dipping that day. Another model, iPhone XS, for $999, comes with a 5.8-inch screen, faster processor and better cameras. It\u2019s being positioned by Apple as a device to take advantage of augmented reality for game playing. A low-cost version of iPhone X called the iPhone Xr, starting at $749, could supercharge unit shipments with a 6.1-inch, LCD screen, instead of newer OLED technology. It comes in white, black, blue, coral, yellow, and red. Consumers are willing to pay more for bigger-screen phones, KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a note to clients Sept 4. \u201cOver the last six years, screen size is the lone feature that we believe has demonstrated a consistent ability to drive both volume and pricing power,\u201d KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote. The trend extends to the next-generation Apple Watch, called Series 4, with screens that are more than 30% larger. The watch, starting at $399, includes a snazzy new electrical heart sensor, which allows it to work as an electrocardiogram. Apple has received Food and Drug Administration clearance for the ECG function. The new iPhones, which go on sale this month and next, mean price reductions on older models. The iPhone 7 will now start at $449, and the Phone 8 at $599. Smartphone sales worldwide have slowed of late. In the second quarter, Apple dropped behind low-cost phone maker Huawei to third place in terms of unit sales. It sold 44.7 million phones, or 11.9% of the market, compared with Huawei\u2019s 49.8 million, or 13.3%, according to Gartner. Samsung Electronics, selling 72.3 million phones, or 19.3%, retained the top spot. Sign up to Review & Preview, a new daily email from Barron\u2019s.

        "content": "For an event steeped in as much secrecy as Apple\u2019s annual iPhone reveal, there is a certain predictability to it all. When Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook takes the stage at the Steve Jobs Theater at the company\u2019s futuristic Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., on Wednesday morning, here\u2019s what\u2019s likely to go down: Expect three new iPhones, Apple Watches with larger screens, refurbished iPad Pros, a new low-cost laptop, a Mac mini desktop computer, and new accessories like the AirPower wireless charger. Over the course of roughly two hours, Cook and a series of Apple executives \u2014 bet on seeing Craig Federighi and Philip Schiller \u2014 will lead product demos and fire up the Apple fan base. Design whiz Jony Ive won\u2019t be on stage but is likely to narrate a brief video clip, extolling the stylish look of the sleek new smartphones. Throw in previews of upcoming TV ads that undoubtedly will draw laughter, oohs and aahs, and you have a marketing blueprint that Jobs perfected long before his death in 2011. Apple stock closed Tuesday up 2.5% on the day, up to $223.85 ahead of Wednesday\u2019s event. Apple stock usually enjoys a significant rise in the 60 days after a major product launch. The stock was up another 0.33% in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Read more: A Market Shakeup Is Pushing Google and Facebook Out of the Tech Sector About the only thing lacking of late has been Jobs\u2019 iconic \u201cone more thing\u201d zinger to end the spectacle \u2014 usually in the form of a surprise musical guest, product or both. A large chunk of Wednesday\u2019s proceedings will almost surely focus on three expected additions to the iPhone line, Apple\u2019s most important and one that accounted for 56% of its $53.3 billion in third-quarter revenue for the three months ending June 30. The smartphone line has served as a vehicle to accelerate sales of services such as app subscriptions, iCloud storage and music downloads. It has also led to purchases of other Apple devices and accessories. Expected to lead the iPhone rollout is a low-cost version of the iPhone X, referred by some as \u201ciPhone Xr,\u201d which could super-charge unit shipments. It comes with a 6.1-inch screen, LCD screen instead of newer OLED technology, and several colors. A second model, deemed \u201ciPhone XS Max\u201d in some published reports, comes with a nearly 6.5-inch screen. The third model, an upgrade of the iPhone X with a 5.8-inch screen, reportedly has a faster processor and better cameras. Some are calling it the \u201ciPhone XS.\u201d It comes in gold, Apple insiders say. Read more: Apple Consumers Will Pay Up for Big Screens All told, the features and pricing flexibility of the new iPhones could move the needle on a market that has slowed of late. Higher average selling prices have helped Apple improve sales, but it has lost worldwide market share. Low-cost smartphone maker Huawei (49.8 million units, or 13.3% of the total) surpassed Apple (44.7 million, 11.9%) to become the No. 2 worldwide smartphone vendor position for the first time in the second quarter, according to Gartner. Overall smartphone sales grew 2% in the calendar second quarter to 374 million worldwide. Samsung Electronics (72.3 million units, or 19.3%) retained the top spot, but it and Apple lost ground to Huawei. The new iPhones, which should be available later this month, could change the dynamic \u2014 especially during the holiday season, Apple\u2019s strongest quarter. The only glitch heading into Wednesday is President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats against China, which, if applied to consumer-electronics products, would force Apple to raise prices on Apple Watch, AirPods, and other products, the company warned last week. Apple recently became the first company to reach $1 trillion in market value.",

        "content": "Hong Kong and Taiwan\u2019s main stock indexes were some of the biggest decliners in Asian trading on Monday, falling 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. A late rebound meant Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index narrowly avoided closing in bear-market territory, or at least 20% below a recent peak. South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Topix ended slightly up. Monday\u2019s Big Theme Shares of companies that supply parts and assemble products for Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% slumped after President Trump called on the iPhone maker to shift production home. Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday that Apple should make devices in the U.S. rather than China if it wants to avoid tariffs. The comment came a day after he said tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese goods could be rolled out on short notice. IPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317 -0.33% , better known as Foxconn, fell 3.3% to a fresh two-year low. The stock was the biggest drag on Taiwan\u2019s Taiex index, which declined 1.1%. Also in Taiwan, shares of lens makers Genius Electronic Optical Co. 3406 1.05% and Largan Precision Co. 3008 2.67% , case maker Catcher Technology Co. 2474 -3.41% and rival assembler Pegatron Corp. 4938 0.44% , dropped between 3% and 9%. In Hong Kong, AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., 2018 1.47% which produces acoustic parts, fell 3.6%. AAC and Foxconn are each down more than 20% this year. Their other challenges include a global slowdown in smartphone sales. Kylie Huang, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in Taipei, said suppliers\u2019 shares would suffer further if Apple agreed to move production to the U.S., but the effects would be uneven. The biggest impact would probably be on the contract manufacturers that assemble Apple smartphones in China, such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That is because this discussion about making goods in the U.S. largely boils down to jobs, she said, and \u201cassembly is more labor-intensive, compared with the components.\u201d Most Apple products are assembled in China, but iPhone parts come from around the world, including Taiwan, South Korea, and the U.S. Ms. Huang said she doesn\u2019t expect Apple to change its camera-lens suppliers, for example, even if it moves some of its production to the U.S. The yuan weakened 0.4% against the dollar in onshore trading, hitting its lowest level in more than two weeks at 6.8655 per dollar.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% removed Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars website from its App Store late Friday, eliminating one of the few remaining digital platforms available to the right-wing provocateur. The technology company took down five apps affiliated with Infowars for violating its app-developer guidelines, an Apple spokeswoman said. Those guidelines preclude apps that deliver content that is \u201coffensive, insensitive, upsetting\u2026or in exceptionally poor taste.\u201d That includes \u201cmean-spirited references or commentary\u201d about religion, race, sexual orientation and gender. Infowars won\u2019t be allowed to return to the App Store, the spokeswoman said. She declined to say what Infowars content violated Apple\u2019s policies or when the company made the decision. The removal came a day after Twitter Inc. permanently banned Infowars and its founder, Alex Jones, from its social-media platform. That followed previous content removals from Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s YouTube. Last month, Apple helped trigger the wave of removals of content related to Mr. Jones, taking down Infowars listings from its podcast directories. But it continued to offer apps affiliated with Infowars in its store, saying it supports all points of views on its App Store so long as developers follow its guidelines. Mr. Jones has argued that Silicon Valley is suppressing his First Amendment rights and trying to stifle conservative viewpoints. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this week he plans to examine what the Justice Department has called intentional efforts to restrict voices on social media.",

        "content": "Investor Gains Galore U.S. Investment Policy Committee Notes by CFRA Sept. 5: Investors have had a lot to celebrate this year and may have even more by year end. The S&P 500 has risen in each of the last five months, during a typically challenging midterm-election year, no less. This string of uninterrupted gains was seen in only one other midterm election year. In 1958 the S&P 500 was also up from April through August, and then gained an average 3.7% in the final four months of the year, with each of the remaining months posting positive performances. Reasons for current optimism include a strong economy, rising earnings, and a gradual and transparent rate-tightening cycle, along with a continued lack of attractive alternatives. Longer term, however, we remain constructive but acknowledge that tougher growth comparisons and a reconfiguring of the Congressional majority could serve as headwinds. --Sam Stovall Morning Briefing by Yardeni Research Sept. 4: Now that the major U.S. stock market indexes are back in record-high territory, I am starting to get more questions from our accounts along this line: \u201cIs the meltup you\u2019ve been expecting happening now?\u201d The short answer is \u201cYes.\u201d The problem with the term \u201cmeltup\u201d is that it suggests the runup in stock prices is speculative, thus raising the odds of a meltdown. However, it\u2019s important to note that the meltup in stocks may be more sustainable because it is based on a meltup in earnings. I started writing about a potential meltup in the stock market in early 2013. I did so because the widely feared \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d at the end of 2012 was averted on New Year\u2019s Day 2013. I concluded that there was \u201cnothing to fear but nothing to fear.\u201d The S&P 500 fell 7.7% in late 2012 on fiscal cliff fears, but still managed to gain 13.4% for the year. It then proceeded to gain 29.6% during 2013 on a big relief rally. --Ed Yardeni Index at Highest Since May 2004 by Maria Fiorini Ramirez, Inc. Sept. 4: The ISM manufacturing composite index was reported to have rebounded strongly to 61.3 in August from 58.1 in July. The August result was well above the median forecast of a decline to 57.6. Earlier results for the composite were 60.2 in June, 58.7 in May, 57.3 in April, 59.3 in March, 60.8 in February, and 59.1 in January. Prior to the just over two-point decline in the index in July, we had been writing the following for several months: \u201cThe manufacturing composite index has been considerably stronger than one would expect given the prevailing pace of GDP growth. While this is consistent with the rebound in real GDP growth in the second quarter following a subpar first quarter, it also points to a likelihood that the ISM measure is going to return to earth, as these types of dichotomies typically don\u2019t persist for too long.\u201d Well, the \u201creturn to earth\u201d scenario lasted for a single month, and now this indicator is back in orbit. Overall new orders are robust even as the export orders subindex languishes, illustrating that domestic demand is driving manufacturing strength. Still, because it is uncertain whether trade disputes will before too long be resolved at the negotiating table or if they are going to lead to something increasingly sinister as far as U.S. manufacturers are concerned, the medium-term health of this sector is still an open question. The Weekly Speculator by Marketfield Asset Management Sept. 6: As we noted last week, the SPX (S&P 500) index had become somewhat overstretched following its break into blue-sky territory, and this was even more striking given the poor performance of global markets in the summer months. As such, it is a little surprising to see the SPX move back to test support at the breakout level (the index bounced at 2876.9 on Wednesday morning) or for the technology sector to lead the decline lower. The NDX (Nasdaq) index declined -1.3% for its worst session since July 30, although it did manage to bounce off the 7500 level a couple of times to cut losses. Neither index is yet in danger of signaling a trend change, and each could survive a full test of its rising 50-day moving average at 2820 and 7358, respectively, without doing significant damage to their prospects, which is something to bear in mind if the selloff accelerates. Within the technology sector itself, there has been a narrowing of leadership, with the trillion-dollar duo ( Apple and Amazon.com ) accounting for 24% of the entire index. At the same time, a number of prior market darlings have come under considerable pressure, with a couple in danger of breaking below longstanding trend lines. Bull markets can survive a narrow leadership for considerable periods (the SPX has only experienced one broad advance in the last five years), but it generally reflects an aging of the cycle when prior favorites start to fall off the bandwagon. So there\u2019s little more at stake for the NDX now than during the last couple of pullbacks. Of course it is outside the U.S. where the bulk of selling pressure has been taking place, and the return from summer vacations seemingly brought with it a wish to cut exposure at the earliest opportunity. Selling has been swift across most developed and emerging markets, with only Japan among major developed markets and Taiwan within the emerging market showing any reluctance to decline. The emerging market complex has once more suffered the greatest losses, with declines in equities, bonds, and FX suggesting a broad withdrawal of capital has taken place. Generally for Asian markets, the majority of losses have been incurred in equity markets, whereas elsewhere (particularly in Latin America) it is FX that has transmitted the bulk of losses. \u2014Michael Shaoul, Timothy Brackett The Most Dangerous Branch , published by Crown Sept. 4: Once upon a time, the exemplar of judicial deference\u2014Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who served on the Court from 1902 to 1932\u2014wrote to his British friend Harold Laski and quipped: \u201cIf my fellow citizens want to go to hell, I will help them. It\u2019s my job.\u201d Holmes was right, even if hell wasn\u2019t the optimal destination. [Chief Justice John] Roberts said much the same thing, more forgivingly, in the first Obamacare ruling: \u201cIt is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.\u201d Impatiently, myopically, with deep distrust in our elected representatives, we have come to believe that our democracy is broken. And we have come to see the justices as our saviors. With so much dysfunction elsewhere in government, the justices see themselves that way too. But we need more politics, not less politics. It is a sign of weakness that we countenance an almighty Court to resolve so many of our hardest choices. We do not need, nor should we want, the Court to save us from ourselves. --David A. Kaplan",

        "content": "These reports, excerpted and edited by Barron\u2019s, were issued recently by investment and research firms. The reports are a sampling of analysts\u2019 thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron\u2019s. Some of the reports\u2019 issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed. Apple AAPL-Nasdaq Buy Price $227.63 on Sept. 3 by Canaccord Genuity Based on our North America survey work, the iPhone maintained its leading market share at all four major U.S. carriers. And, overall, iPhone sales remained resilient with a likely share over 50% at each of those carriers. Given the strong consumer satisfaction with the phones, we anticipate that Apple will continue to grow its global share of the premium smartphone market. Further, we believe that Apple\u2019s ecosystem will contribute to strong ongoing growth for services revenue, and we expect the higher-margin services growth to continue, outpacing total company growth. We also believe that Apple is likely to launch three new iPhones in September, possibly at lower price points. That suggests greater segmentation, which could lead to year-over-year unit growth in calendar 2019. We also believe that the iPhone global installed base will exceed 700 million in 2018, and that such an impressive number should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and earnings, as well as cash flow generation, both of which will fund strong long-term capital returns. We reiterate our Buy rating and increase our price target from $220 to $250 based on our new 2020 estimates. United Parcel Service UPS-NYSE Strong Buy Price $122.88 on Aug. 31 by Raymond James We are upgrading shares of the shipping and logistics company to Strong Buy from Market Perform, as we believe the market is underappreciating its long-term (2021) domestic Ebit and free-cash-flow outlook, which we estimate at greater than $8 billion. Specifically, our above-consensus view of year-ahead free cash flow is driven by a detailed buildup that assumes the benefit of a combination of company-specific initiatives such as the deployment of UPS\u2019 Smart Logistics Network, the reversal of operating penalties currently in profit-and-loss statements, an eventual sun-setting in a heightened capital-expenditures cycle, and a dearth of discretionary pension payments, coupled with organic growth driven by e-commerce tailwinds. Lastly, at approximately 13 times our hypothetical 2021 free-cash-flow per share estimate (excluding any incremental transformation benefits), we see a favorable upside/downside skew. We are tweaking our 2019/20 earnings-per-share estimates to $7.91/$8.90, respectively. Our $150 price target is based on approximately 18 times our hypothetical 2021 free-cash-flow/share estimate, roughly in line with the company\u2019s historical 2013-17 next-12-months price/earnings ratio. Chubb CB-NYSE Buy Price $135.24 on Sept. 4 by Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners We continue to believe that Chubb has one of the best collections of insurance businesses in the industry. They include unique undertakings like its high-net-worth personal lines business, its broad international platform, and its dominant directors\u2019 and officers\u2019, or D&O, insurance business. Over the long term, we continue to expect that this unique profile will deliver earnings that are among the most consistent. While Chubb\u2019s more recognizable property-casualty insurance businesses are diverse, its largest business is writing commercial insurance. Chubb is also a large writer of excess and surplus lines insurance and has a modest reinsurance operation. About 30% of its premium revenue is from accident and health and life insurance products, offering diversification from the cyclical property-casualty insurance industry As to earnings, we are maintaining our 2018 EPS estimate of $10.60; this compares to the current consensus of $10.43. We are also maintaining our 2019 EPS estimate of $11.20; this compares to current consensus of $11.23. We are maintaining our Buy rating and $170 price target. The price target is based on applying a multiple of 140% to our one-year forward (third-quarter 2019) book value estimate of $119.76. State Street STT-NYSE Overweight Price $86.91 on Aug. 31 by Morgan Stanley The trust bank/bank holding company\u2019s P/E multiple is at a five-year low after it announced that it is acquiring Charles River Development, a more technology-and software-oriented bank. Investors are hitting State Street for financing dilution caused by the acquisition but ignoring CRD\u2019s potential earnings and synergy contributions. We upgrade State Street to Overweight on valuation and upcoming catalysts. In particular, we expect catalysts over the next six to 12 months to include more clarity on the acquisition, announcements of large clients signing up for CRD\u2019s products, and, in 2019, a resumption of share-buyback programs. No other large-cap bank stock we follow is, like State Street, priced for fears of recession. That, plus the catalysts we expect, drive its shares to the top of our Overweight list (from a previous place on our Equal Weight list). Our price target goes from a previous $109 to $115.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said proposed U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods would affect its watch, wireless headphones and other products, the first time the company has detailed specific damage that could potentially hit its hardware lineup stemming from the trade battle. The proposed tariffs of up to 25% on specific products imported from China to the U.S. would hit \u201ca wide range of Apple products,\u201d the company said, including its Mac mini computer, chargers, adapters, specialized manufacturing machinery and more. \u201cTariffs increase the cost of our U.S. operations, divert our resources and disadvantage Apple compared to foreign competitors,\u201d Apple wrote in its filing with the U.S. Trade Representative. \u201cMore broadly, tariffs will lead to higher U.S. consumer prices, lower overall U.S. economic growth, and other unintended economic consequences.\u201d Apple declined to comment beyond its filed statement. The White House didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment. Apple is among the most vulnerable U.S. companies amid rising trade tensions, trade experts say. The company manufactures the vast majority of its products in China and exports them to the U.S., making them potential tariff targets. It also has a sizable business in China, which the Chinese could target in retaliation for U.S. trade actions. \u201cThe first few rounds of tariffs hit supply chains really hard,\u201d said Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse University. Now, the Trump administration \u201chas begun to hit things clearly not processed in the U.S.\u2014consumer goods\u2014and this is going to get people\u2019s attention.\u201d The tariffs would have an impact on some of the smallest contributors to Apple\u2019s total revenue. AirPods and the Apple Watch are part of a product segment that contributed $12.86 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended September 2017, or 5.6% of Apple\u2019s $229.23 billion in total sales. The iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of Apple\u2019s total sales, hasn\u2019t been affected by the proposed tariffs yet. However, that could change if the Trump administration follows through with earlier threats of levies on $500 billion in imports, which would cover just about everything China exports to the U.S., trade experts say. Chief Executive Tim Cook has played down the threat of tariffs, telling analysts in late July that Apple hadn\u2019t been affected to date. He said Apple would provide public comment after evaluating the proposal. Mr. Cook personally has encouraged President Trump to avoid a major trade confrontation with China, telling the president during one-on-one meetings dating back to late 2016 that it would negatively affect American companies including Apple, according to a person familiar with those meetings. Mr. Cook has expressed optimism the U.S.-China trade situation would \u201cget sorted out because there\u2019s an inescapable mutuality\u201d between the two countries. \u201cEach country can only prosper if the other does,\u201d he said in the summer call with analysts. \u201cAnd of course, the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper, for the world to do well.\u201d The proposed tariffs follow 25% duties the Trump administration already has placed on $50 billion in goods from China, aimed at putting a stop to what the White House has said is China\u2019s theft of U.S. intellectual property, the forced transfer of American technology and cyberattacks on U.S. computer networks. In its filing, Apple challenged that approach, writing that \u201cit is difficult to see how tariffs that hurt U.S. companies and U.S. consumers will advance the Government\u2019s objectives with respect to China\u2019s technology policies.\u201d The public comment period on the new tariffs ended Thursday, the last step before a decision. Apple was among several tech companies to submit comments regarding the proposed tariffs. Intel Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and others argued in their filings that the tariffs could hamper U.S. competitiveness in 5G, an emerging wireless technology the White House has set up as critical to national security.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. received the European Union\u2019s approval Thursday to acquire Shazam Entertainment Ltd., allowing the technology giant to close one of its most prominent deals in years\u2014and helping its music business to battle Spotify Technology SA for streaming-music subscribers. The approval follows an investigation by the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s regulator, assessing the deal\u2019s impact on competition in Europe, in line with the EU\u2019s strategy in recent years to closely scrutinize mergers involving data-rich companies. Regulators were concerned that by acquiring Shazam\u2014an app that helps users identify songs playing around them\u2014Apple could gain access to commercially sensitive data about its competitors\u2019 customers, allowing Apple to encourage them to switch to its own streaming service, Apple Music. \u201cAfter thoroughly analyzing Shazam\u2019s user and music data, we found that their acquisition by Apple would not reduce competition in the digital music-streaming market,\u201d said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager. The decision follows a string of setbacks for Silicon Valley firms in the EU, which has developed a reputation in recent years for being one of the world\u2019s toughest enforcers of antitrust law. Apple has clashed recently with the commission, including over a 2016 decision ordering the Cupertino, Calif.-based company to pay Ireland \u20ac13 billion ($16.2 billion) in allegedly unpaid taxes. Apple announced the acquisition of U.K.-based Shazam in December last year. After identifying a song, Shazam directs users to Apple Music or Spotify to listen to and potentially buy or stream the music. It would also give Apple access to additional information on consumers\u2019 musical interests.",

        "content": "When you buy a share of Apple stock, you do not simply buy into a $1 trillion technology company. You also buy a share of one of the world\u2019s largest investment companies: Braeburn Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple. Braeburn manages a $244 billion financial portfolio\u201470% of Apple\u2019s total book assets. Apple acts like a hedge fund by supporting this portfolio with $115 billion of debt. Like a hedge fund, Apple provides minimal disclosures on Braeburn Capital\u2019s holdings. But unlike a hedge fund, Apple does not restrict itself to accepting funds from sophisticated investors. Apple invests the money of everyday investors, like a mutual fund\u2014but without telling investors what they own, the most basic protection mutual funds offer. Equity and debt holders beware. Similar shadow hedge funds abound within S&P 500 industrial companies. Most disclose less information than Apple about their activities. Our research, published in the Journal of Finance, shows that in 2012 these corporations managed a combined portfolio of $1.6 trillion of nonoperating financial assets. Of this amount, almost 40% is held in risky financial assets, such as corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, auction-rate securities and equities. Current accounting standards require companies only to report aggregate valuations on a quarterly basis. Like Apple, these companies lever up. The debt may appear safe at first when it is backed by financial assets. But these assets are not the safe and liquid ones that typically facilitate day-to-day operations. By shifting into riskier and more illiquid financial assets, corporations hurt their debt holders, ostensibly to help equity holders. Equity holders don\u2019t seem to gain any benefit, though. Our research shows that large holdings of risky financial assets are associated with the destruction of value. The market values a dollar of risky financial assets at substantially less than a dollar. Large risky asset holdings are also associated with poorer corporate governance, CEO overconfidence and risk-incentivizing executive compensation such as stock- and option-based pay. Through these shadow hedge funds, industrial companies chase after alpha. But beating the market is hard, and the attempt destroys value through fees and the ensuing management distraction from the core business. Only the most select hedge-fund and mutual-fund managers outperform the market. It seems unlikely that the financial industry\u2019s best money managers would choose to work for industrial companies at lower pay. Moreover, if corporate treasurers truly create value, companies should be happy to trumpet their success. Instead they hide their results from investors by taking advantage of weak disclosure requirements. Harmonizing the disclosure standards of these shadow hedge funds with those required of mutual funds and other financial intermediaries\u2014including quarterly reporting of every asset held and daily marking-to-market of the portfolio value\u2014is critical for an informed investor base. This could be accomplished. Any company holding more than 1% of book assets in non-cash-equivalent financial securities should be required to hold these assets in a subsidiary that reports its net asset value daily. Investors should be able to evaluate the performance of these shadow hedge funds for themselves and decide how they want to invest their money.",

        "content": "BEIJING\u2014Under fire from Chinese state media, Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said it removed illegal gambling apps from its App Store in China\u2014a move that could help quell the latest challenge for the American tech giant in its most important market outside of the U.S. \u201cGambling apps are illegal and not allowed on the App Store in China,\u201d Apple said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe have already removed many apps and developers for trying to distribute illegal gambling apps on our App Store, and we are vigilant in our efforts to find these and stop them from being on the App Store.\u201d Apple had been criticized by Chinese news outlets for not doing enough to filter banned content and applications. State broadcaster CCTV, which last month reported that Apple\u2019s app store allowed illegal gambling apps disguised as official lottery apps, said Sunday that 25,000 apps had been removed. Apple offers more than 1.8 million apps in China, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Apple didn\u2019t confirm the number of apps it took down or when it had removed them, but 25,000 would amount to about 1.4% of that total. Apple occasionally cleans up its App Store in the U.S. as well, removing outdated or spam apps. In China, Apple said it removed nearly 700 virtual private networks, or VPN, apps from its App Store last year in response to new local restrictions. VPN is used by individuals and companies to send secure emails, transmit data and access websites blocked in China. The state media attacks came at a vulnerable time for Apple, which like other U.S. companies operating in China, is caught in the middle amid growing trade friction between Washington, D.C. and Beijing. U.S. companies are paying close attention to the messages they get from the Chinese government and the state media in this sensitive trade environment, said Ben Cavender, a director at China Market Research Group who focuses on consumer technology and retail. \u201cThey are going to move very quickly to try to rectify that problem, because this is a situation where there could be a lot more backlash in the government in terms of regulations,\u201d Mr. Cavender said. In its latest report on the app housecleaning, CCTV also said that illegal apps that were banned from the App Store would still be working on devices of users who had downloaded them. It also said that fake positive reviews for the illegal apps had misled some users. \u201cApple itself has set up the rules on how to allow apps onto its store, but it didn\u2019t follow that, resulting in the proliferation of bogus lottery apps and gambling apps,\u201d it said in its report. Apple\u2019s strong ties to China leaves it exposed should trade tensions ratchet up. China accounts for about one-fifth of its revenue. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company also assembles its iPhones in China, which means the iPhones are a Chinese export that could potentially be subject to tariffs in the trade row. Trade experts say China could hurt U.S. companies either through tariffs or other measures, including media-led campaigns against U.S. goods. Despite concerns, American branded goods including Apple\u2019s iPhones continue to be popular in China, with Apple\u2019s retail stores and many other U.S.-brand stores attracting customers as usual. The state media criticism against Apple also comes at a time when the Chinese government is tightening control over the internet environment, as regulators strive to block news and entertainment content at odds with Communist Party values. Last month, multiple media including state-controlled news agency Xinhua published criticism of Apple for not doing enough to filter banned content on its iMessage service. Apple has pointed to tools on iMessage that can help users filter or block spam. Messages sent through the iMessage service are encrypted, which means only the sender and the receiver can access it. The company says it can\u2019t decrypt those messages and doesn\u2019t log any messaging content. Analysts have said that since Apple\u2019s operating system doesn\u2019t allow encrypted messages to be read, its spam filters aren\u2019t as effective as Google\u2019s Android platform, which allows users to grant access to third parties to read their messages for better spam filtering. \u2014 Yang Jie contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Share buybacks are when a company purchases its own common shares on the open market. After a buyback, a company is left with less cash and fewer shares outstanding. Buybacks, along with ordinary dividends, are one of the main ways companies return cash to investors\u2014the ultimate objective of any investment. So why have buybacks become the subject of vitriolic criticism? Prominent publications have run headlines calling buybacks, among other things, a \u201cscam\u201d that is \u201ckilling the American economy\u201d and asserting that they \u201cloot the future.\u201d These attacks are mostly empty. The criticism is typically linked to debates about inequality and corporate short-termism but it also comes from virtue-signaling CEOs who want people to think they care about the long term. These attacks are growing in frequency, prominence and intensity. A lot of people are suffering from buyback derangement syndrome. The lead accusation against buybacks is that they \u201cstarve investment.\u201d We can look at aggregate investment directly, examining the investing section of the statement of cash flows for all companies in the Russell 3000. Normalized by either total assets or total market capitalization (debt plus equity), net investment is lower than it was in the 1990s but positive and much higher than during the 2008 financial crisis. Yet the lack of a precipitous decline in investment doesn\u2019t stop critics from complaining about \u201cinvestmentless growth.\u201d Related to the claims of starving investment, some argue that today\u2019s buybacks are a form of \u201cself-liquidation\u201d in which companies are systematically shrinking away. This ignores that there are other sources of funds aside from common stock. Over the past few years the net cash outflow from share buybacks has been more than replaced by cash inflow due to new borrowing (think of this as a debt-for-equity swap). Despite buybacks, on net companies have been raising money, not liquidating. It would strike a financial economist as odd to believe that investment is being curtailed by financing decisions like whether to repurchase shares or issue debt. Basic financial theory says any profitable (above the cost of capital) investment should be undertaken, with financing done at the lowest cost of capital. Whether this holds true is difficult to test, given all the possible counterfactuals. But there is, again, not much in the data to suggest any obvious failure of theory. If investment had truly fallen off a cliff along with the rise in buybacks, we\u2019d at least have to worry about causality. It didn\u2019t happen. Further, investors generally do not spend the money paid out in buybacks on champagne bubble baths or other forms of consumption. Rather, they reinvest it in other stocks and bonds. Buybacks thus facilitate a movement of capital from companies that don\u2019t need it to those that do. That\u2019s how markets are supposed to work. Another criticism is buybacks \u201cartificially\u201d raise earnings per share. This is certain only if the rest of a repurchasing company\u2019s business is unchanged and the cash used for the buyback was completely idle. Otherwise, the true long-term effect on EPS growth will be determined by the return to the company had it retained and employed the cash. Again, this is how it\u2019s supposed to work. If the returns to a company using the cash for a buyback are low, the company is supposed to give the cash back. Yet another claim is that much of the market rise over the last few years has been from buybacks. The numbers don\u2019t bear this out. The direction is plausible, as researchers have found that share prices do tend to increase\u2014by around 1%\u2014when buybacks are announced. Several explanations have been offered for this positive reaction including that investors see repurchases as a signal that management thinks shares are undervalued, and that investors cheer when management returns cash to shareholders rather than, perhaps, wasting it on \u201cempire building.\u201d These explanations are behavioral effects at the margin. But critics often assume that shareholders moving cash from the corporate balance sheet to their personal one is a pure windfall\u2014never mind that they own the same set of assets before and after, and you can\u2019t loot yourself. It would be impossible to determine precisely how much of the more than 15% annual returns on the Russell 3000 since the financial crisis is a direct consequence of share repurchases, but there is no compelling evidence that it is more than a small fraction. The most wild-eyed critics actually claim that some specific companies are giant \u201cscams\u201d fueled by buybacks. Apple is the most notable target of these critics, who assert that much of its approximately $1 trillion market capitalization is an illusory artifact of share repurchases. That\u2019s backward. Buybacks reduce market capitalization. Remember, buybacks are also accused of causing the stock market to \u201cself-liquidate.\u201d What Apple is accused of is a contradiction in terms\u2014self-liquidating to $1 trillion. Oh, and they sold some iPhones along the way, too. While not the main focus of the critics, there are some possible problems with buybacks. If taken to excess far beyond today\u2019s levels and financed with debt, they could lead to too much leverage (aggregate leverage today is pretty normal). Moreover, there may be ways in which corporate management can use share buybacks tactically to increase the value of stock options and other incentive contracts at particular times. This can and should be fixed with contracts written to adjust for the impact of buybacks, not by eliminating the benign buybacks themselves. The bottom line is that despite a legion of attempts, there is no real case against buybacks, let alone enough to blame them for all sorts of economic ills. Much of the criticism is innumerate nonsense. Nonetheless, the various charges are repeatedly made in otherwise reputable places, with increasing stridency, by people who should know better to people who presumably don\u2019t. That suggests the attack on buybacks is a politically motivated crusade\u2014let\u2019s blame public corporations for all kinds of evil. Americans have lots to debate, and those critical of public corporations likely have many other worthwhile points to make. They should drop nefarious buybacks from their retinue of accusations and focus on real problems.",

        "content": "Elon Musk is known for disrupting convention, and his midday tweet Tuesday that he may take his Tesla car company private is a classic. Many people have lost money betting against the Tesla CEO. Then again, nearly $70 billion is a lot to borrow to escape the needling of short sellers and stock-analyst grunts. But that does seem to be Mr. Musk\u2019s overriding motivation for wanting to go private, judging from his email to employees that Tesla released after his tweet. \u201cAs a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote in his memo. \u201cFinally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201d If Mr. Musk does go private, he\u2019d face no more questions from stock jocks, journalists and other pains in the posterior who ask about the Tesla Model 3 production line and cash flow. He could put a sign out front that says \u201cGenius at Work\u201d and tell everyone to buzz off unless they want to test drive one of the cars. Everyone, that is, except the lenders who finance what would be the most expensive leveraged buyout in history. Calculating from the 20% or so of Tesla shares that Mr. Musk already owns, and his target LBO price of $420 a share, he\u2019d have to raise tens of billions of dollars. Mr. Musk tweeted that he has \u201cfunding secured,\u201d without naming the sources.",

The reports are a sampling of analysts\u2019 thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron\u2019s. Some of the reports\u2019 issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed. Apple AAPL-NasdaqBuy Price $190.29 on July 31 by Guggenheim Securities We see Apple\u2019s beat-and-raise performance once again driven by upside in iPhone average sale prices and growth in its services businesses, with the first being key to offsetting mature smartphone unit growth and the second to expanding its price/earnings ratio. September-quarter guidance looks strong into an upcoming iPhone refresh that we continue to see coming on time, with larger screen sizes that were noticeably absent from last year\u2019s model X launch. Focusing for a moment on that September-quarter product refresh, we believe that iPhone component suppliers have now burned off their inventory of second-half 2017 overbuilds and are starting to reaccelerate second-half 2018 estimated production. The headlining new phones will probably include both a 6.5-inch iPhone X and a 6.1-inch LCD-based iPhone that adds the X\u2019s \u201cnotch\u201d for 3-D and facial-recognition applications. We are raising our earnings estimates, and our price target has been increased another $10, to $235. We also reiterate our Buy rating on the shares. Wells Fargo WFC-NYSEBuy Price $57.29 on Aug. 1 by Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners This afternoon, the Department of Justice and Wells Fargo announced that the bank will pay $2.09 billion to resolve a previously disclosed DOJ investigation regarding pre-crisis residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, activities. We have known for years that this issue was outstanding (and it has been in Wells Fargo\u2019s filings, as well), but we have to admit that it had not been top-of-mind for us for some time. Regardless, we are glad that the company can now put it in the rearview mirror. This is an issue from long ago, and the penalty has already been accrued. While we never like to see one of our companies agree to a multibillion-dollar fine, we do not consider this a big deal for investors. Put simply, this strikes us as something to \u201ccheck off the list, and then move on.\u201d We say this for three reasons. First, this agreement resolves pre-crisis issues, specifically related to 2005-07 RMBS activities. So it has to do with problems from over a decade ago, and we suspect that most investors have moved on from these concerns. Second, this is not a Wells Fargo-specific issue. Most of the large banks we can think of entered into similar agreements to resolve these issues. Wells Fargo\u2019s just took more time to resolve. But we should at least point out that Wells Fargo\u2019s settlement involves no customer remediation. That seems to make it less complicated, in that Wells Fargo can pay the penalty and pivot to other things. Third, there is no go-forward financial impact. Again, Wells Fargo has already fully accrued for the settlement amount, so we do not have to worry about any impact to earnings or tangible book value. We are glad to be able to check this off the list of outstanding issues for Wells Fargo, and we do not believe that it should have any impact on the shares. We reiterate our Buy rating, and our price target is $64, which assumes the shares will trade at about 12.5 times our 2019 earnings-per-share estimate of $5.12 a share a year from now. Automatic Data Processing ADP-NYSEIn Line Price $134.99 on July 31 by Evercore ISI ADP\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal-year 2018 earnings surpassed our estimate, driven by revenue and pretax margin outperformance from its employer services business, and lifted by expense savings from its strategic transformation initiatives. Overall client retention declined 120 basis points, or 1.2 percentage point, stemming from some large PEO [professional employer organization] client losses, although client retention in the midmarket segment of employer services improved. We maintain our target price of $142. Aflac AFL-NYSEBuy Price $46.54 on Aug. 1 by Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners We are upgrading shares of the provider of mostly supplemental health and life insurance, primarily in Japan and the U.S., to a Buy rating from a Hold. We\u2019ve done this for four reasons. 1) With the company\u2019s Japan-branch conversion and reorganization completed, second-quarter 2018\u2019s earnings results revealed that there was considerable pent-up Japanese agent demand for Japanese products, which is now being taken into account. 2) It appears that the company has finally cracked the mystery of getting U.S. distribution of its Japanese products. 3) It has also become a beat-and-raise story with the shift in its products into third sector from first sector, which in Japan allows the sale of a wider range of insurance products under one company name. 4) While Aflac is often described as a life insurance company when it\u2019s compared with other insurers, it will be more attractive to investors if it clearly presents the wider range of its products. Our target price stands at $52. To be considered for this section, material should be sent to Research@barrons.com.",

        "content": "While the world watched Apple reach one stock market milestone this past week, it was quietly approaching another. On Thursday, the Cupertino, Calif., colossus became the first U.S. company to reach a market value of $1 trillion. That same day, its shares traded at 15.8 times projected earnings for the next four quarters, which, according to FactSet, makes them only 5% less expensive than the broad S&P 500 index. Just two years ago, Apple shares were 30% cheaper than the market. In other words, Apple (ticker: AAPL) is on its way to trading at a premium price, which it hasn\u2019t done in nearly six years. That might make this look like a wise time for shareholders to take profits. But they should hang on for more upside, for two reasons. First, investors are finally beginning to give the iPhone maker credit for more than its handset volumes, including its swelling trade in services and accessories. At the same time, the setup for handsets going into the fall is promising. Second, Apple compares well with the broad market on measures of risk, financial strength, and growth potential, which means it arguably deserves a premium valuation. It wouldn\u2019t take much of one to send shares 20% higher over the next year. When Barron\u2019s warmed to Apple shares four years ago, the appeal was simple\u2014big screens. Samsung Electronics (005930.Korea) and others had them. Customers wanted them. Apple was poised to offer them, meeting pent-up demand for upgrades among its loyal user base. The stock price, a split-adjusted $76, was agreeable, at a 21% discount to the market, relative to earnings, and Apple held cash and investments equal to a third of its market value. When the big screens arrived, demand was fierce, setting off what Wall Street has come to call an iPhone supercycle. Unit sales jumped 37% during the fiscal year ended in September 2015. Last fall, there was chatter about the 10th anniversary phone setting off a sorta-supercycle. At the time, sales for the year through this September were expected to reach 243 million handsets, meaning 12% growth\u2014stellar, considering how saturated the smartphone market has become. But the latest consensus estimate is 219 million handsets, for just 0.9% growth. Consumers, it turns out, weren\u2019t ravenous for phones they can unlock with their faces, or for the ability to drop augmented-reality dinosaurs into their backyards. But there\u2019s more to Apple than iPhone unit growth. It is moving beyond big peaks and troughs for handset sales and toward steadier growth, as we wrote in a cover story late last year, where we predicted the company would win the race to 13 digits. Revenue from services, including the app store, music streaming, movie rentals, AppleCare repair plans, and online storage, is growing quickly. Gadgets beyond iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers are selling well, too\u2014like AirPods, which are wireless earbuds, and the Apple Watch 3, which brings stand-alone phone service. Apple shares have risen to $207 from $175 since that article. They got a boost from the corporate tax cut, which included a sweetener for companies with overseas cash to bring home, prompting Apple to more than double its spending on stock buybacks compared with last year, to $53.6 billion during the nine months through June 30. Apple\u2019s latest earnings release, dated July 31, called out record services revenue, which rose 31%, year over year, to $9.5 billion during the third fiscal quarter. The company\u2019s \u201cother products\u201d sector, which includes accessories, watches, Apple TV, and more, brought in $3.7 billion, up 37%. For the iPhone, unit sales grew just 1%, but revenue jumped 20%, to $29.9 billion, as buyers snapped up pricier models. Overall revenue rose 17%, to $53.3 billion, and profits, 32%, to $11.5 billion. Earnings per share soared 40%, to $2.34, easily topping estimates. Apple shares gained 6% the day after the report. Analysts gushed about services, which are believed to carry gross margins above 60%, compared with a companywide 38%. But let\u2019s not overstate the case; with 56% of revenue coming from iPhones last quarter, Apple is still a handset company. According to Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley, Apple appears to be taking market share from Samsung, its primary competitor in high-end phones. \u201cWe believe our [calendar 2019] estimates could prove conservative, as new iPhones could drive a stronger replacement cycle than the initial iPhone X,\u201d wrote Walkley on Wednesday, referring to the 10th anniversary phone at the top of the lineup. This fall, Apple is widely expected to introduce a phone with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, like the X, as well as a pricier 6.5-inch version and a cheaper model with a 6.1-inch LCD screen. That could lure holdouts who were put off by higher prices to upgrade, while testing the limits of what big spenders will pay. There are the usual rumored upgrades, like a jazzier camera, and some new rumors, like something called dual-Sim functionality, which would allow users to switch carriers when traveling, and could prove popular in China. But the best reason to expect a good year for upgrades might be the simplest: Those millions of projected upgrades that didn\u2019t happen in recent quarters represent more iPhone users with old phones who will be eyeing the next launch. In addition, Apple still has cash and investments equal to nearly a quarter of its market value. With a rising portion of profits coming from subscriptions, its earnings trajectory in recent years has had a statistical smoothness befitting a consumer-staples company, but with much faster growth. Next fiscal year, Wall Street predicts, earnings per share will rise 15%, and the one after that, 12%. All of that makes a 5%-to-10% premium valuation for Apple look plenty reasonable, and its shares worth holding for longer.",

        "content": "Trade War No, Negotiation Yes Morning Briefing by Yardeni Research July 31: President Donald Trump continues to pursue his agenda of boosting U.S. economic growth while upending the old-world order of trade. Most economists seem to believe there is an internal contradiction in Trump World. Free trade, even if it isn\u2019t completely fair trade, is better than no trade, according to the conventional view. Trade boosts economic growth on balance. So, Trump\u2019s latest pronouncements on the subject seem to be designed to drive economists to distraction: Over-the-top growth? On Friday, Trump told talk-show host Sean Hannity that the U.S. could achieve unprecedented growth rates if the trade deficit were cut in half. His remarks followed the release of second-quarter real gross domestic product showing a 4.1% (SAAR, or adjusted) growth rate. He claimed that the country could reach GDP growth of 8% to 9%: \u201cIf I cut [the trade deficit] in half, right there we will pick up three or four points.\u201d Saving money? The previous day, on Thursday, speaking in Granite City, Ill., Trump declared, \u201cWe lost $817 billion a year, over the last number of years in trade. In other words, if we didn\u2019t trade, we\u2019d save a hell of a lot of money.\u201d These statements fly in the face of everything that economists have believed about trade since Adam Smith demolished comparable mercantilist beliefs in The Wealth of Nations (1776). Smith convincingly argued that high tariffs immiserate a nation, while low tariffs and flourishing trade increase the wealth of a nation. The risk is that Trump\u2019s art-of-the-deal antics backfire, causing an escalation of the trade war and triggering a recession. Billionaire Charles Koch told reporters at his political network\u2019s conference on Sunday that Trump\u2019s trade policies could prove to be \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Koch said, \u201cAny protectionism at any level, certainly at a national level, is very detrimental. There are scientific and historical reasons. I mean, every nation that has prospered is one that didn\u2019t engage in trade wars.\u201d On the other hand, economists will uniformly applaud Trump if his bilateral trade negotiations\u2014which have resulted from his threats to shut off trade with our major trading partners\u2014succeed in lowering tariffs. The stock market rallied at the end of last week when Trump essentially agreed to a cease-fire in his trade war with the European Union, so that negotiations can proceed. \u2014Ed Yardeni The Weekly Speculator by Marketfield Asset Management August 2: The SPX index failed in its first attempt to challenge its January all-time high, with last Wednesday\u2019s intraday high at 2848.03 never being surpassed in the last five sessions. The pullback saw the index briefly breach key support at 2800 on Monday, then stage a modest recovery to close at 2813.36 last night. Although we wouldn\u2019t overstate the damage from the failed assault, how this new 50-point (roughly 2%) range between 2800 and 2850 is resolved looks to be quite significant. An upward breach would set up an immediate challenge of the all-time high at 2872.87, while a move below 2800 would potentially be followed by a move down to 2700, which now combines the late-June low with the rising 200-day moving average. One noticeable change in recent sessions has been the position of the SPX versus the other two indexes we follow. The small-cap RTY index has been under some pressure, as we had expected. The index fell below its rising 50-day MA this week and has struggled to retake it in subsequent sessions. The overall damage so far is quite modest, but the manner in which it was chased higher as a \u201ctrade haven\u201d in June probably requires a deeper pullback. The index has had a pattern of alternating outperformance and underperformance in recent quarters, and we believe that we are witnessing a repeat at the current time. \u2014Michael Shaoul, Timothy Brackett Economic Update by Regions Financial August 1: The Institute of Supply Management, or ISM, Manufacturing Index slipped to 58.1% in July, a larger decline than we and the consensus anticipated, but one that nonetheless leaves the headline index above the 50% break between contraction and expansion for a 23rd consecutive month. Last month, we noted the headline index was stronger than was implied by the underlying details, as a sharp slowdown in supplier delivery times was the primary catalyst for the spike in the headline index. In that sense, the level of the headline index in July can be seen as a more apt portrayal of conditions in the manufacturing sector, as new orders, current production, employment, and export orders all logged further growth. That said, the slower pace of growth of current production bears watching, as it could reflect a number of factors, including higher inventories, labor shortages, or shortages of raw materials. At the same time, trade continues to loom as a dark cloud on the horizon, but here we\u2019ll make the same point we made last month, which is that at present it seems the main risks from trade are more to the breadth and intensity of the robust expansion in the factory sector than to the expansion itself. Of the 18 industry groups included in the ISM survey, 17 reported expansion in July with only the primary metals industry reporting contraction, which could reflect the adverse effects of ongoing trade battles. Still, as has been the case for some time now, the expansion in the factory sector remains notably broad-based. Comments from survey respondents center on a few key themes\u2014still-solid growth in demand, disruptions from trade policy, and increasing difficulty in finding skilled labor. One respondent, in the wood-products industry, noted that orders from China have virtually dried up, which is leading to higher inventories, which in turn are causing the firm to rethink sales and revenue projections. The U.S. manufacturing sector remains on an impressive roll, but while growth in demand remains solid, supply constraints, whether due to inadequate labor supply or slowing deliveries of materials, seem to be adding to the stress. And on top of these, trade policy remains a source of uncertainty. \u2014Richard F. Moody U.S. Investment Policy Committee Notes by CFRA August 1: From the recent peak on July 25 through the end of the month, the S&P 500 Information Technology sector\u2014which represents more than 25% of the market value of the \u201c500\u201d\u2014fell 5% in price-over-revenue and/or earnings misses by prominent social-media companies. Encouragingly, investors rotated rather than retreated, pushing seven of the 11 sectors higher by nearly 1% or more during this same period, allowing the S&P 500 to slide by only 1%. Tech pressure may have been broken by Apple \u2014the core holding in the S&P 500 on a market-value basis, representing nearly 4% of the index\u2014when it posted better-than-expected growth in EPS and revenue. In addition, Apple\u2019s impact on the S&P 500 appears to have assisted in a successful retest of the 2789 breakout level, implying that the recent rise from the prior trading range has staying power. \u2014Sam Stovall",

        "content": "Apple AAPL 0.85% Inc. on Thursday became the first U.S. company to surpass $1 trillion in market value, underscoring the iPhone maker\u2019s explosive growth and its role in the technology industry\u2019s ascent to the forefront of the global economy and markets. Shares of the world\u2019s most valuable public company rose $5.89, or 2.9%, to $207.39, making it worth slightly more than $1 trillion. Apple reached the milestone when it climbed above $207.04 in midday trading. The stock has risen 23% so far this year, its latest rally coming after it reported strong revenue and profit gains Tuesday as demand for high-price iPhones remained resilient and sales from the app store and other services hit all-time highs. Apple\u2019s rise has been propelled by the sustained success of the iPhone developed under late co-founder Steve Jobs, a product visionary who helped revive the company from a death spiral in the late 1990s. His successor, Tim Cook, has turned Apple into a cash-generating giant by pushing its existing products to prominence in China and cultivating its rapidly growing services business\u2014moves that have helped stave off concerns about the absence of a new, blockbuster device. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a number of times since Mr. Jobs died that the company was going to slip and fall, but they\u2019ve continued to execute,\u201d said Greg Hersch, founder of New York City-based Florence Capital Advisors, which has more than $400 million under management and counts Apple among its largest holdings. Along the way, Apple has led a broader tech boom that has made a handful of giant companies central in people\u2019s daily lives and investment portfolios. The five most valuable companies\u2014Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc.\u2014are all tech and internet firms, a level of industry dominance rare in recent markets history. Those five collectively accounted for nearly 15% of the total value of the S&P 500 as of last month, according to Ned Davis Research. The iPhone, and the smartphone era it birthed, helped lift other tech giants\u2014and disrupted many other businesses. Smartphones drive mobile advertising businesses at Google and Facebook, and account for an increasing share of the e-commerce transactions lifting Amazon. Technology\u2019s ubiquity, and the industry\u2019s swelling wealth and clout, also have triggered growing criticism and regulatory scrutiny\u2014one of several factors that could undermine the boom. This year, Apple confronted investor pressure to address the public health risks of rising youth smartphone addiction. Facebook and Google were grilled by U.S. lawmakers over data privacy. Amazon\u2019s business practices were slammed by President Donald Trump. Some money managers worry that a few highflying firms are powering the broader market, leaving stocks susceptible to a painful downturn if the rally ends. Apple, founded as an upstart maker of personal computers in 1976, first took the crown as the largest company in August 2011 when it edged out Exxon Mobil Corp. , signifying tech\u2019s displacement of energy as market king. At the time, Apple was valued at roughly $343 billion. Mr. Jobs died a few months later, having transformed the company from a niche computer company to a global electronics powerhouse. But Apple kept rising, cementing its market-cap lead in August 2013 and holding it consistently since then except for a few days in 2016 when Alphabet was bigger. More recently, Apple has had to hold off Amazon, which was worth just a third of Apple\u2019s value in 2011 but whose stock recently has surged as it shows it can grow profit as well as sales. Amazon was worth about $890 billion on Thursday, and Alphabet was worth about $860 billion. Microsoft, at more than $825 billion, isn\u2019t far behind. The calculation of Apple\u2019s market value is based on the company\u2019s share count as of July 20. Share counts fluctuate day by day based on factors like stock buybacks, but generally aren\u2019t disclosed more than a few times a year. Apple isn\u2019t the world\u2019s first company to claim the $1 trillion title. In 2007, PetroChina Co.\u2019s market cap surpassed that level by some measures, though the Chinese oil and gas producer\u2019s corporate structure kept most of its shares locked up in government hands, making it difficult to determine the firm\u2019s actual value. Outside of the public markets, there is Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the state-owned oil company. It weighed an initial public offering that could value the business at as much as $2 trillion. The plan has stalled however, and the actual value of the company, known as Saudi Aramco, isn\u2019t clear. Apple\u2019s ascent is especially remarkable since its survival as a company was in doubt just over two decades ago. It lost $2 billion over two years in the mid-1990s, weighed a sale to Sun Microsystems, and churned through three CEOs in four years before bringing back Mr. Jobs. He revived the business by thinning Apple\u2019s product lineup and spearheading a trio of hits: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Mr. Cook, who took over in 2011, broadened the iPhone\u2019s reach, helping it become one of the best-selling products in history, with more than 1.4 billion devices sold. Huge numbers were sold in China, a market that exploded in 2015 after Apple signed a deal with the largest mobile operator. China now accounts for a fifth of Apple\u2019s sales. The iPhone also underpinned Apple\u2019s services sales, which Mr. Cook set the goal of doubling in four years to $50 billion by 2020. On Tuesday, he said Apple is on track to hit that goal thanks to accelerating subscription sales, growing transactions on Apple Pay and other factors. The iPhone X, which launched last November, has delivered minimal unit growth, but its $999 price tag has lifted total sales by raising average iPhone selling prices 15% higher to $750 in the nine months ended in June. In May, Apple announced it would add $100 billion in share repurchases, the largest ever announced by a company.

Some investors worry about the escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China however. Apple acknowledged this week that those tensions could increase its manufacturing costs and dampen product sales. In the longer term, investors worry about Apple\u2019s ability to launch another transformational product like the iPhone. Its smartwatch, which debuted in 2015, made Apple the world\u2019s largest watch company by sales but hasn\u2019t delivered the same type of boost that other hit products have. \u201cOne of the things that has always concerned us is the concentration in the iPhone,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, which owns the stock. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there is a risk that there is some gee-whiz product in the next 12 to 24 months that is going to unseat the iPhone as the king.\u201d",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% delivered its best-ever revenue for what is typically its weakest quarter, as demand for high-price iPhones remained resilient and services such as app-store sales swelled to a record. The results for Apple\u2019s fiscal third quarter show how the iPhone maker is finding ways to grow amid a contracting global smartphone market that is roiling its rivals. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing strong double-digit growth in revenue, and we\u2019re making great progress toward our goal of significantly expanding our services business,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook said during a call with analysts. Though iPhone sales usually weaken in the spring and summer as anticipation builds for new devices expected in September, Apple finance chief Luca Maestri said demand has remained consistent, particularly for the iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus. Shares of Apple, up 28% over the past year, rose 3.7% to $197.33 in after-hours trading. With a market value above $950 billion if after-hours gains extend to Wednesday\u2019s trading day, Apple is on the cusp of becoming the first $1 trillion U.S. company. Apple\u2019s move to raise iPhone prices continued to pay off in the period, with sales of the company\u2019s flagship product rising 20% to $29.91 billion even as shipments rose less than 1% to 41.3 million. The company\u2019s services business reported record revenue of $9.55 billion, a 31% increase from a year earlier, strengthening the case that Apple is in the midst of a transformation from a device-driven business into one increasingly reliant on sales of subscriptions and software. Revenue growth accelerated for the seventh straight quarter, jumping 17% to $53.27 billion in the latest period, above Wall Street expectations and near the high end of its own guidance. Profit rose 32% to $11.52 billion, or $2.34 a share, also above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. \u201cThe larger business plan is on track,\u201d said Robert Nichols, chief executive at Windward Capital Management Co., a Los Angeles-based firm with more than $750 million under management that counts Apple among its largest holdings. \u201cThey\u2019ve created this device vehicle to push entertainment and data through, and it\u2019s almost like having a cash register and waiting for sales.\u201d Apple\u2019s report Tuesday capped a string of strong earnings from U.S. technology giants Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. , which continue to post robust results in the face of increasing scrutiny from regulators over their influence on business and society. Facebook Inc. remained the outlier, with its shares suffering the biggest-ever one-day loss last week after it warned of slowing growth amid new regulatory pressures and public scrutiny of its privacy practices. Still, escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China pose a greater threat to Apple than its peers. The company depends on China for about one-fifth of sales, making it vulnerable to potential retaliation by the Chinese government, trade experts said, and its iPhones would be hit by tariffs if President Trump follows through on a recent threat to put tariffs on some $500 billion in Chinese exports to the U.S. Apple hasn\u2019t been affected by any U.S. tariffs on imports from China to date, but Mr. Cook said the company is evaluating the planned tariffs for potential business impact. He said Apple will provide public comment after it has had a chance to evaluate the potential tariffs. Still, Mr. Cook said he is optimistic \u201cthis will get sorted out because there\u2019s an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China.\u201d Apple also faces criticism from Chinese state-controlled media, which has turned up attacks on Apple over the past week, with at least five state supported outlets including Xinhua criticizing the tech giant\u2019s iMessage service for failing to do more to block spam messages. CCTV jumped in Tuesday, saying Apple\u2019s app store allows illegal gambling apps. Apple\u2019s sales continue to grow in Greater China, rising 19% to $9.55 billion. But new numbers from market researcher Strategy Analytics found that Huawei Technologies Co. of China has overtaken Apple for the first time as the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone maker, with 54 million devices shipped in the June quarter. Apple\u2019s chief rival, Samsung Electronics Co. , remains the largest smartphone vendor, but has struggled lately. The South Korean company, which also has raised smartphone prices to nearly $1,000, reported a big decline in mobile-phone profit on Tuesday as consumers hold on to devices longer and balk at higher prices. Its market share in China has declined as homegrown rivals such as Huawei increase sales. Apple signaled it expects to sustain strong iPhone sales in the current quarter with a forecast for total revenue of between $60 billion and $62 billion, which would represent a healthy 14% to 18% increase from a year earlier. Analysts say the likely jump reflects a small boost from the following three new devices Apple is expected to release in September: an update to the $999 iPhone X; the company\u2019s first oversize phone with an organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display; and a 6.1-inch liquid-crystal-display phone with facial-recognition technology. The new phones are projected to be priced between $699 for the LCD device and $1,099 for the plus-size handset, according to UBS, potentially ensuring another year of higher average iPhone prices to lift Apple\u2019s total revenue. Analysts had estimated the $999 iPhone X made up one-quarter of total iPhones sold, which helped boost average selling prices per iPhone by nearly 20% to about $724. Given consumer sensitivity to higher smartphone prices, future iPhone \u201cpricing will be important going forward,\u201d said Mike Frazier, president of Bedell Frazier Investment Counselling, a Walnut Creek, Calif.-based firm with about $500 million under management. Apple is among the firm\u2019s largest holdings. \u201cExpectations are pretty high for the next phone launch and people won\u2019t want to pay a grand unless it\u2019s full of new innovative functions,\u201d he added. The services business has become one of Apple\u2019s biggest growth engines. The company is making progress toward its goal of $50 billion in annual sales behind growth in subscriptions to iCloud storage, its streaming-music service and offerings such as Netflix and HBO. Paid subscriptions now exceed 300 million, a 60% increase in the period, Mr. Maestri said. The division that includes Apple\u2019s smartwatches and AirPods wireless earbuds also posted another period of strong gains, with sales rising 37% to $3.74 billion in the June quarter. The company doesn\u2019t break out smartwatch sales, but it is expected to increase shipments 14% this year to 20.2 million watches, according to International Data Corp., a market-research firm. \u201cThis is a product category that essentially didn\u2019t exist three years ago,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. Sales of iPads and Macs were the only weak areas for Apple, as revenue for both products fell 5% in the period. Apple continued to flex its financial muscle during the period, repurchasing $20 billion of shares. The company promised in May to spend a record $100 billion on buybacks. The buybacks could move Apple shares 24% higher over the next three years, according to Loup Ventures, a research-focused venture-capital firm. In January, the company announced a plan to return the majority of more than $250 billion in overseas cash holdings to the U.S. That followed the U.S. tax overhaul Mr. Trump signed into law late last year, which requires companies to pay a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash. Apple, which will pay $38 billion in taxes, has said it aims to become net-cash neutral in the future, and it reduced the gap between cash on hand and debt to $129 billion, Mr. Maestri said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go in our share-repurchase program,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. Nearly 10 years ago, reporter Nick Wingfield spoke to the Apple CEO shortly after the launch of the App Store. Their conversation covered the store\u2019s early success, developer relationships, the future of gaming, Facebook and more. Listen and read the full transcript.

        "content": "BEIJING\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% has come under fire by Chinese state media, which claims the U.S. technology giant isn\u2019t doing enough to block texts and images trafficking in prohibited content including pornography, gambling and counterfeit goods. In a barrage that began last week, China\u2019s state-controlled news agency Xinhua and at least four state-supported media outlets have published criticism of Apple for not doing enough to filter banned content on its iMessage service. State broadcaster CCTV joined in Tuesday on another front, saying Apple\u2019s app store allowed illegal gambling apps disguised as official lottery apps. Apple declined to comment on the media criticism, but pointed to tools on iMessage that can help users filter or block spam and other unwanted content. The company has in the past said it complies with local laws for the countries in which it operates. On Monday, China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and other top government agencies said they would impose new requirements requiring mobile-phone makers to include spam-filtering features. The state-controlled media criticism comes amid rising trade tensions, with President Trump in July threatening tariffs on virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S. With only about $130 billion in imports from the U.S., China has limited options for retaliation, say trade experts, who expect the country to either increase duties on U.S. imports or punish U.S. companies, including Apple. China\u2019s media has turned up criticism of international business during past international affairs disputes. During tensions over a South Korean plan to deploy an antimissile system, sales of Korean goods in China tumbled as state-controlled media encouraged a retaliatory campaign by consumers. Apple depends on China for about one-fifth of its revenue. When sales in the market fell 26% in the three months ended in March 2016, Apple\u2019s stock tumbled to a low of $90.34 within months. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the order might affect iPhones, because Apple says it provides anti-spam measures. But a finding that Apple isn\u2019t in compliance could lead authorities to shut down any functions found in violation, said Yang Zhaoquan, a lawyer with Beijing Vlaw Law Firm. In its news story, Xinhua quoted experts saying Apple could technically intercept and block messages with prohibited content, but chooses not to because it doesn\u2019t want to be seen as infringing on user privacy. Apple has promoted iMessage as a secure way for users of its iPhone, iPad and other devices to communicate, via encrypted messages that only the sender and receiver can access. The company says it can\u2019t decrypt the messages and doesn\u2019t log any messaging content. According to Apple, users can automatically filter out unknown senders, which could help them screen spam. They can also report a spammer to Apple by clicking a link beneath a message. But reporting a junk message doesn\u2019t automatically block the sender, who must be barred manually on the device. Since its operating system doesn\u2019t allow encrypted messages to be read, Apple\u2019s iMessage isn\u2019t as effective with spam filters as Google\u2019s Android platform, which allows users to grant access to third parties to read their messages for better spam filtering, Counterpoint Research analyst James Yan said.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal third quarter after the market closes Tuesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know: EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts on average expect earnings of $2.18 a share, according to Thomson Reuters, compared with $1.67 a share a year ago. The company hasn\u2019t provided earnings guidance for the quarter but in February said it expects gross margin of 38% to 38.5% in the quarter. REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $52.34 billion is expected by analysts, compared with $45.4 billion reported a year earlier. In February, Apple said it expected revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion in the quarter. WHAT TO WATCH \u2014KEEP ON MOVING: Though smartphone sales continue to slow globally, Apple has avoided getting caught in the downdraft. The company is expected to report another modest increase in sales of iPhones in the June quarter, and pack enough of a punch with higher average selling prices to lift total revenue by a double-digit percentage. Analysts forecast unit sales growth of 2% and estimate the $999 iPhone X made up one-quarter of total iPhones sold, which would help lift average selling prices per iPhone by about 14.5% to $694. The expected results would extend the company\u2019s consistent performance with the iPhone X, leading many investors and analysts to turn their attention to a new batch of iPhones expected in September. Analysts expect Apple to project total revenue in the current quarter of $59.5 billion, a 13% increase driven by three new iPhones expected in late September\u2014a 6.1-inch OLED model, a 5.8-inch OLED model and a 6.1-inch LCD model. A year ago, Apple only released the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in the three months ended in September and the iPhone X in November. \u2014TIME MAY CHANGE ME: Apple is in the midst of a business transformation, shifting from a reliance on traditional hardware sales into a company that increasingly leans on software sales from subscriptions, apps and mobile payments. Chief Executive Tim Cook put a spotlight on that effort last year when he set a goal of doubling revenue from the company\u2019s services business to about $50 billion by 2020. The company is expected to report that services revenue rose more than 25% to $9.2 billion in the June quarter, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Such growth would extend Apple\u2019s history of double-digit-percentage revenue increases for services and give investors some confidence that the company will be able to deliver future revenue growth as iPhone prices level off and unit sales stagnate. \u2014CROSSFIRE: Trade tensions between the U.S. and China pose a threat to Apple\u2019s future. The company\u2019s decision to assemble most iPhones in China means those devices could be hit by U.S. tariffs if President Donald Trump follows through on threats to impose duties on some $500 billion in imports from China. Meanwhile, China\u2014which imports only about $130 billion in goods from the U.S.\u2014has few tools to retaliate and could target U.S. companies, including Apple, trade experts say. Beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s statements that both countries should find a way to grow the economic pie, Apple has said little about the trade issue, and analysts will likely ask for an update on the company\u2019s position. \u2014GOT THE SILVER, GOT THE GOLD: Apple announced in May a plan to repurchase $100 billion in shares. This week\u2019s earnings call should offer the first insight into how quickly Apple is moving to return that cash to investors. Goldman Sachs estimates the company repurchased $25 billion in stock during the June quarter and forecasts a similar rate of repurchases over the next three quarters. Considering Apple announced a plan to bring more than $250 billion in cash to the U.S. from overseas earlier this year, it still has ample cash to spend as it tries to fulfill its stated plan of becoming net cash neutral. Teeing up more repurchases in the future would raise the company\u2019s earnings per share and could move Apple shares 24% higher over the next three years, according to Loup Ventures, a research-focused venture-capital firm.",

        "content": "The phrase on the back of iPhones\u2014\u201cDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China\u201d\u2014highlights a key reason for the company\u2019s remarkable success but also shows how exposed it is to the escalating U.S.-China trade fight. By assembling its phones in China, Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% tapped into China\u2019s vast workforce and formidable manufacturing capabilities. But it also made Apple\u2019s most-profitable product a Chinese export\u2014one that could be subject to tariffs in the trade dispute. On top of that, China is by far Apple\u2019s most important market outside the U.S., leaving it exposed if Beijing decides to retaliate by squeezing its sales. \u201cThey should be nervous,\u201d said David Dollar, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution, who was the U.S. Treasury\u2019s top official in Beijing during the Obama administration. Smartphones weren\u2019t included in the levies on $34 billion of Chinese goods imposed on July 6, nor are they targeted in a second round worth $16 billion that is expected in August. They also haven\u2019t been included in a third round of $200 billion in goods that the Trump administration identified earlier this month. Apple\u2019s revenue breakdown by region Greater China Others U.S. 29.5% $229 billion in 2017 51% 19.5% billion $70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 \u201917 \u201916 2013 \u201915 \u201914 Sources: the company; Loup Ventures (estimate for U.S. share of Americas revenue) But now, President Donald Trump is threatening levies on a total of $500 billion in imports, which would cover just about everything China ships to the U.S., including iPhones, trade experts say. The U.S. imported about $45 billion in mobile phones from China last year, according to data from the International Trade Centre. China imports much less from the U.S.\u2014about $130 billion in goods annually\u2014which limits its options for tit-for-tat tariffs. But China could retaliate with higher duties and punitive actions against American companies. Apple would be a likely target because of the iPhone\u2019s 9% share of China\u2019s smartphone market, according to Mr. Dollar and other trade experts. Apple declined to comment. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has made the company\u2019s China business a pillar alongside the one in the U.S., has maintained his customary cool as tensions rise, while courting officials in Beijing and Washington. In March, he visited Beijing and called for open trade at an event hosted by the Chinese government. \u201cCountries that embrace openness, that embrace trade, that embrace diversity are the countries that do exceptionally,\u201d Mr. Cook said. In a visit to the White House in April, Mr. Cook told the president tariffs weren\u2019t the right approach to trade issues, the Apple CEO said in a subsequent TV interview. iPhone 7 factory or component value by country or region Total: $237.45 Unidentified 9.2% Europe: 2.8% China: 3.6% 6.9% South Korea Taiwan 20.1% Japan 28.5% U.S. 28.9% Sources: Jason Dedrick, Syracuse University; Greg Linden, University of California, Berkeley; Kenneth Kraemer, University of California, Irvine; IHS Markit \u201cThey\u2019re working to engage the administration to make sure there aren\u2019t unintended consequences both here in the United States and in China,\u201d said Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, of which Apple is a member. China already imposes a value-added tax of 16% that affects iPhones. Apple has other potential targets for retaliation, including about 40 retail stores in China and an App Store that is the largest in spending world-wide. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and the State Council Information Office didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. For Washington and Beijing, dragging Apple into the trade fight carries risks. Mr. Trump could anger American consumers if tariffs make the popular iPhone more expensive. He would also be taking on the world\u2019s most valuable company, which has promised to contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. Included in that figure is a one-time tax of $38 billion on its overseas cash holdings, which came in response to a major overhaul of the U.S. tax code. China also has an interest in keeping the peace, given the number of jobs Apple provides. About 10,000 people in China are employed directly by Apple, the company said. Indirectly, Apple says it accounts for three million jobs there through its supply chain, which includes contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Co. It also says it provides work for 1.5 million app developers in China. \u201cIt\u2019s like a double-edged sword. If the Chinese government really tries to do something, that will hurt itself,\u201d said Yuqing Xing, an economics professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo who has written about iPhones and U.S. trade. Apple is more vulnerable to smartphone tariffs than rivals because it hasn\u2019t diversified its manufacturing. Though the company looked at assembling iPhones outside China in recent years, including in Vietnam, it found the costs of facilities and training too high and opted to keep exporting most iPhones from China, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the U.S., a tariff of 10% on a Chinese-made iPhone X would add about $37 to the import cost of $368, according to market researcher IHS Markit. Apple would either eat those costs on the $999 device or pass them on to retailers and consumers, says Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. Rival Samsung Electronics Co. , on the other hand, makes more than 80% of its smartphones outside China and would avoid similar duties. In China, Apple\u2019s business was squeezed in 2016 when the government halted its online music and book services. Such measures show how China can harm Apple\u2019s business in retaliation for tariffs, trade experts and analysts said. \u201cChina can infinitely dial these up and dial them down,\u201d said Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who focuses on China and trade. \u2014 Xiao Xiao contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said it would launch a $300 million clean-energy fund for China with 10 of its suppliers, extending the U.S. tech giant\u2019s commitment to China at a time of mounting trade tension between its home country and its most important overseas market. The China Clean Energy Fund, which Apple said it and its partners will fund over four years, will invest in and develop-clean energy projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in the country. Those investments will be used to power operations of the 10 participating suppliers, including Taiwan-based Pegatron Corp. 4938 0.44% and Wistron Corp. 3231 0.34% , which assemble iPhones. Apple has gone on a charm offensive in China in recent years as it has looked to shore up its relationship with the Chinese government and consumers. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who travels regularly to the country, last year spoke at a major Chinese government conference, around the time Apple announced investment in two research-and-development centers in Shanghai and Suzhou. Those efforts have taken on added importance amid an intensifying trade battle between the U.S. and China. The Trump administration early this month imposed a 25% tariff on $34 billion in Chinese imports and has scheduled another $16 billion to hit later this month. China has responded with tariffs on 545 items, including agricultural products. The trade fight thrusts Apple into a difficult position. The company assembles most of its iPhones in China and imports them to the U.S., which accounts for about 30% of its $229 billion in total sales, according to analysts. Meanwhile, China has grown to become one of its largest markets, accounting for about 20% of total sales. That straddling of the U.S.-China divide creates risks for Apple that Chinese officials could see its market position there as a bargaining chip with Washington, analysts say. The concern is that the Chinese government could find ways to slow approval of Apple products at customs or stir consumer sentiment against the company. \u201cAs this ratchets up, Apple should be concerned,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a professor of economics at Syracuse University. The China Clean Energy Fund fits into Apple\u2019s ongoing efforts to reduce its environmental impact. The company announced in April that it had achieved its decade-old goal of having its facilities world-wide powered exclusively by renewable energy, including retail stores, offices, data centers and partner data centers, as well as its new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The investment also aligns with goals of China\u2019s government, which has prioritized renewable energy to wean the country off its reliance on coal power and address public dissatisfaction with rampant air pollution in its cities. The China Clean Energy Fund will be managed by Deutsche Bank AG \u2019s DWS Group, which also will invest in the fund, Apple said. Apple\u2019s largest iPhone assembler, Foxconn Technology Group, isn\u2019t participating in the fund. The fund is the latest example of Apple using its balance sheet to support public policy interests in its most important markets. Since May last year, it has committed $5 billion toward an advanced manufacturing fund supporting U.S. manufacturing. It had faced criticism during the presidential campaign from then-candidate Donald Trump for outsourcing the production of iPhones to factories in China.",

        "content": "Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.38% is cutting prices on its Surface devices, introducing a $399 tablet to compete with Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s least-expensive iPads. The new 10-inch Surface Go, which ships Aug. 2 in the U.S. and two dozen other markets, is the least costly among the five Surface devices that Microsoft makes. The Surface Go is aimed at the same potential buyers as Apple\u2019s 9.7-inch iPad, which starts at $329. Microsoft\u2019s Surface devices have been showcases\u2014computers made with premium materials that have sleek designs intended to highlight the capabilities of the Windows operating system and spark creativity among its hardware partners. Only a few of those partners, like Asustek Computer Inc., 2357 0.65% offer designs similar to what Microsoft is introducing. The Surface portfolio has produced uneven results for Microsoft, though in the past few quarters the devices have sold well. In the three months ended March 31, Surface generated $1.09 billion in sales, up 32% from a year earlier. Tablet shipments world-wide fell 11.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to International Data Corp., a market-research firm. One bright spot was shipments of tablets with detachable keyboards, such as the Surface, which grew 2.9%. Surface Go devices purchased in stores will run Windows 10 in \u201cS mode,\u201d a variant of the operating system that the company introduced last year. Windows S only permits users to run apps obtained through Microsoft\u2019s online Windows Store. The idea is to make the devices more secure by limiting applications to those Microsoft has verified. But some popular apps, like Google\u2019s Chrome browser, aren\u2019t available. Microsoft will let customers switch, at no cost, to the regular version of Windows 10. The company is also offering a Surface Go that runs Windows 10 Pro, a version of the operating system that business customers use for its management features, for $449. Customers can pay more to bump up storage and memory on both versions. And Microsoft will sell two versions of a cover that includes a keyboard for an additional $99 to $129.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will hear an Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% appeal challenging the propriety of a lawsuit brought by consumers who allege that the company illegally monopolized the sale of iPhone apps. The justices, in a brief written order, said they would review a lower-court ruling that said consumers had legal standing to proceed with their claims. Oral arguments will take place during the court\u2019s next term, which begins in October. The case, Apple v. Pepper, centers on allegations that consumers pay artificially high prices for iPhone apps because Apple maintains an exclusive marketplace for their sale and charges a 30% commission to app developers. If developers could sell directly to iPhone users and eliminate Apple as the middleman, prices would be lower, the plaintiffs allege in their proposed class-action lawsuit. Apple denies that it has engaged in anticompetitive conduct and says app developers, not the company, set the prices for apps sold in the iPhone maker\u2019s App Store. The App Store has become a significant contributor to Apple\u2019s total revenue, generating about $100 billion in sales for developers since its inception a decade ago. Last year, the company said the App Store generated more than $26.5 billion for developers\u2014a figure that implied Apple collected $11.36 billion based on its 30% share of such sales. The lawsuit, if it is allowed to proceed, poses a threat to that business at a delicate time for Apple. Sales of the company\u2019s iPhones are slowing and it is aiming to deliver future revenue growth from its services business, which include the App Store, mobile payments and its music-streaming business. As the case comes to the Supreme Court, the immediate dispute centers on who has the ability to sue over alleged overcharges. Apple says app developers would have been the direct victims of any alleged overcharges, and that consumers can\u2019t sue for damages on the theory that some of the higher prices were passed onto them. The company cited a 1977 Supreme Court ruling that said claims for damages belong only to the immediate victims of anticompetitive conduct, meaning that downstream purchasers of a product can\u2019t bring such claims. Consumers say they can sue because they bought the apps directly from Apple through an online store that it owns and operates. The high court last October asked the Trump administration for its views on the case. In response, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco urged the court to intervene, saying the lower court was incorrect in allowing the lawsuit to go forward. At the same time, Mr. Francisco suggested that governing Supreme Court precedent in such cases has proven to be unworkable.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% has formed a production partnership with Oprah Winfrey to make programs for its planned subscription-video service, part of the company\u2019s aggressive push into the content business as competition for Hollywood talent escalates. Apple has joined an arms race for top producers and actors by tech giants and traditional media companies alike. All parties are trying to recruit the most valuable talent they can to help programming stand out in a fragmented TV landscape where consumers\u2019 choices are growing. Neither Apple nor Ms. Winfrey offered any specifics about the content she would make. In a statement Friday, Apple said Ms. Winfrey would \u201ccreate original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world.\u201d Apple wasn\u2019t the only suitor for Ms. Winfrey. Last year Amazon.com Inc. also had talks with her about making content for its Amazon Prime service, a person familiar with the matter said. Although Apple has very deep pockets, a commitment it made to spend $1 billion on content pales in comparison to the $8 billion that streaming giant Netflix Inc. is expected to spend this year. Among other players, Hulu is expected to approach $3 billion for programming this year, an amount that HBO also is likely to approximate. Netflix, in particular, has signed up an array of star producers, including \u201cScandal\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes and \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d producer Ryan Murphy, luring them away from traditional studios. The old media companies have vowed to fight back. Last week, Time Warner Inc,\u2019s Warner Bros. announced a $300 million deal to keep prolific TV producer Greg Berlanti from jumping ship. AT&T Inc. now owns HBO and Warner Bros., after closing its acquisition of Time Warner on Thursday. \u201cI have no trepidation about making sure we maintain those relationships with the very top talent going forward,\u201d John Stankey, the AT&T executive charged with overseeing Time Warner assets, said in an interview Friday. Apple doesn\u2019t have a launch date for its planned direct-to-consumer video service, but people familiar with the company\u2019s plans say it is expected to debut next year. Ms. Winfrey is the latest big fish Apple has landed. In recent months, it has struck deals with actor and producer Reese Witherspoon, comedy star Kristen Wiig and directors J.J. Abrams and M. Night Shyamalan. Though Apple hasn\u2019t outlined its distribution plans for the programming or said what it may charge, the company is expected to create a subscription offering that bundles access to the programming with iCloud storage and potentially other services like magazine subscriptions, people familiar with the plans said. The video push comes as the company faces a slowdown in sales of iPhones, which account for two-thirds of total revenue. It is leaning on its services business\u2014which includes App Store sales, mobile payments and its music-subscription business\u2014for growth. Apple has set a goal of generating about $50 billion in sales from services in 2020, up from $29 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year.The video-subscription service would contribute to that growth. \u201cApple needs an underlying growth driver\u201d and \u201coutside of increasing prices for the iPhone, it\u2019s difficult to decipher where growth for Apple comes from unless services can deliver,\u201d said Mike Olson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. The Oprah partnership comes a year after Apple poached two top Hollywood executives from Sony Corp. to spearhead the video effort: Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, who oversaw Sony Pictures Television productions such as \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d Their approach is a departure from Apple\u2019s initial programming efforts, which began in 2017 and resulted in shows like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke.\u201d Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, who oversees services, recently reorganized his team and gave former Time Warner Cable executive Peter Stern responsibility for overseeing business operations for services, people familiar with the change said. Mr. Stern is expected to work with Messrs. Erlicht and Van Amburg on crafting subscription plans for the Hollywood content and Apple\u2019s other offerings, the people said. Since retiring from hosting her daytime talk show in 2011, Ms. Winfrey has increasingly focused her efforts on content production while keeping herself in front the camera as an occasional interviewer. She co-founded the Oprah Winfrey Network with Discovery Inc. in 2011. Last year, she reduced her holdings in OWN to 25.5% from 50% but is still heavily involved in the network. Ms. Winfrey\u2019s relationship with OWN won\u2019t change as a result of this deal, a Discovery executive said. Her agreement with the network and Discovery runs through 2025. After initially struggling to find traction, OWN in recent years has turned itself around and launched several successful scripted shows including \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d and \u201cGreenleaf.\u201d Ms. Winfrey has also been a contributor to the CBS news magazine \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d and her Harpo Productions makes the popular daytime shows \u201cDr. Phil\u201d and \u201cRachel Ray.\u201d Her film company made the theatrical release \u201cSelma.\u201d \u2014Ben Fritz contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple AAPL 0.85% introduced at least seven things at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference that could actually make your life better. After a year filled with bug fixes and heavy user criticism about everything from fragile MacBook keyboards to Siri\u2019s incompetence, Apple\u2019s focus was on improving existing things rather than introducing new ones. It didn\u2019t do enough, at least not during the keynote, to address the bugs and shortcomings of its core products. But it did show us it had some real user needs in mind with these improvements. When you connect your phone to Apple\u2019s in-car infotainment system, you\u2019ll now be able to use navigation apps other than Apple Maps. That\u2019s a potential life-changer, since most iPhone owners we know prefer Waze and Google Maps on the road. FaceTime is nice when the children want to see their grandparents or you want to have a quick face-to-face with a colleague, but group video or voice calls always required a separate app. No longer: iOS 12 supports FaceTime calls with up to 32 participants. If you\u2019re the type to cover your Mac\u2019s desktop in files, only to lose them in the sea of icons, you might like MacOS Mojave. A feature called Stacks automatically clumps together related files\u2014all your images in one pile, all your PDFs in another. You\u2019ll finally be able to see your wallpaper again. A big keynote theme this year was helping people use their iPhones in a saner way. With iOS 12, Do Not Disturb gets better. You will be able to turn off notifications at a given location, like a movie theater. The notifications will automatically resume when you leave the premises. It also hides lock-screen notifications at night, so you don\u2019t get sucked in if you\u2019re just checking the time. Siri\u2019s basic functionality still seriously lags behind Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Apple\u2019s Shortcuts should help it work a little better for you, by letting you create multistep routines. When you say \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d for instance, your lights can turn off and the thermostat can turn down. It likely takes a lot of back-end plumbing, though, so hopefully outside developers will get on board. Apple was caught throttling the performance of older phones with degraded batteries, so now it\u2019s addressing concerns about obsolescence. iOS 12 supports phones going back to the iPhone 5S, and Apple says everyday tasks on the system will be faster\u2014even for the old-timers. Apple does its best work when it helps people invisibly, rather than offering a menu of options and making users pick. Some of these features will be inherently helpful, while others may suffer from neglect, buried deep in menus. Will users find the new Do Not Disturb controls? Will they go through the steps needed to create Siri Shortcuts? Still, if there\u2019s a bright side to the lack of earth-shattering news at this WWDC keynote, it might just be that Apple has decided to slow down\u2014 to think about what its users want and need, to understand better how they work and why they\u2019re frustrated.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% on Monday unveiled new controls to help people curb the amount of time they spend on iPhones and iPads, as well as allow parents to remotely track and limit their children\u2019s use of those devices\u2014a response to growing societal concern that adults and children are too focused on phones. The company said a new app it will release in September called \u201cScreen Time\u201d will provide users with weekly reports of the apps they use and allow them to set time limits for their use of those apps. Parents will be able to use the system to remotely monitor the apps their children use and limit their time on devices. The new features played a central role at Apple\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, a gathering of about 6,000 developers who create the apps for the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers. The event is designed to show off Apple\u2019s latest software\u2014including the newest features to further integrate into people\u2019s digital lives. Those new features include a new Shortcuts app that will connect the Siri voice command with certain apps\u2014for instance, Siri could state flight and hotel information from the Kayak app with a voice command. Apple also introduced new augmented technology, such as a Measure app to capture the dimensions of objects, as well as group video chat on FaceTime. In the middle of all these announcements to drive interactivity, Apple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, paused to talk about ways to \u201cprevent distractions\u201d and limit device use. Apple has been under pressure this year to address those issues. In January, the company received a letter from activist investor Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares. The letter urged the tech giant to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily, and to study the impact of overuse on mental health. On Monday, Jana and Calstrs sent a new letter to Apple to commend the moves, but also sought to continue pressing the company to work with experts in studying the impacts of phone usage. \u201cThis must be an ongoing effort,\u201d they wrote, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, adding the \u201cethical leadership\u201d will create long term stock value. Kevin Holesh, a founder of the app Moment, which helps people track their device usage, said Apple\u2019s moves were \u201ca good first step\u201d and overdue. But he questioned whether setting limits on usage actually works. Among the 5.5 million users who have downloaded Moments and used the app\u2019s own limits function, their time was only reduced by two minutes on average a day on the iPhone and iPad, he said. \u201cLimits are easy to turn off, and it doesn\u2019t solve the underlying reason of why you\u2019re picking up the phone or an app to begin with such as boredom or loneliness,\u201d Mr. Holesh said. The amount of time people spend on mobile devices has increased by more than an hour over the past five years to 3.3 hours a day, according to research by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. A survey sponsored by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that promotes responsible media and technology use for children, found about half of 620 families in 2016 said they felt addicted to their smartphones, and several studies have found smartphones can increase anxiety. The findings have fostered concern that smartphones could trigger a mental-health crisis for youth growing up with the device. It has also stoked worries, including among some iPhone creators, that adults are spending too much time on their devices and not being present enough in the everyday world. The concerns have created a predicament for leading smartphone software developers Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. They\u2019re now trying to strike a balance between releasing exciting features that make smartphones and tablets more useful for users, potentially increasing the time they spend on those devices, with new tools that empower them to control how much they use the devices. Google responded last month by announcing its Android mobile operating system, which has an 85% market share world-wide, according to International Data Corp., would add a new dashboard that allows users to set time limits for apps and make the screen automatically turn gray when they\u2019re ready for bed. The company already offers a system called Family Link that allows parents to remotely track their children\u2019s screen time. Though Apple has offered parental controls for years, analysts say the system only allows parents to set limits on their children\u2019s device use\u2014not monitor it on a continuing basis. The new \u201cScreen Time\u201d feature changes that by giving parents those same capabilities. A new Reports feature will detail how users spend time with the iPhone and iPad, including how often per hour they look at their devices, when they are using particular apps and what apps are sending the most notifications. \u201cIf Apple leads the way and we do a good job of educating parents and the public about using the tools, this could be a major step forward in addressing the challenges of attention, addiction and distraction,\u201d said Jim Steyer, founder of Common Sense Media. Among the new software features for the company\u2019s new mobile software, known as iOS 12, the Shortcuts app for Siri is among the most important strategically for Apple. Siri, which made its debut in 2011, has lost ground to Alexa and Google Assistant as those rival systems opened up to third-party developers, allowing users to verbally order pizza or play trivia. Shortcuts is designed to improve Siri\u2019s capabilities by allowing users to program their phone for specific actions. For example, a user could program a setting called \u201cHeading Home,\u201d and when the user says those words using Siri, it would automatically pull up National Public Radio and provide a traffic report for the drive home from work. The custom tools show the company is in the earliest phases of a transition, seeing Siri as a platform for users rather than just another feature on its devices, said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cUntil they change the way they look at Siri, it will never be able to compete with Google and Alexa,\u201d she said. Siri\u2019s limitations contributed to some negative reviews of Apple\u2019s smart speaker, the HomePod, which launched earlier this year and was faulted by reviewers for being largely limited to playing music at a time when devices like the Amazon Echo could be used to answer questions and order products like paper towels. \u201cApple felt the urgency a year ago and a year later it has become even more urgent for it to catch up in this field in a decisive manner,\u201d said Werner Goertz, a technology research director with Gartner, Inc.",

Apple \u2022 AAPL-Nasdaq Hold \u2022 Price $187.90 on May 29 by Maxim Group We are downgrading Apple\u2019s shares from Buy to Hold because, in our view, the company\u2019s subscription services\u2019 long-term opportunity is not attractive enough, and we expect fiscal 2019 to be a down year. Prior survey data indicate that attach rates for subscription services will be at best 30% and probably lower, given Apple\u2019s \u201call-encompassing\u201d ecosystem-centric approach, and especially for services where entrenched incumbents already exist. Utilizing Spotify , Dropbox , and Netflix consensus estimates, we believe that Apple subscription services at maturity will yield at best a corporate 25% operating margin. So, given the risk we see that fiscal-year 2019 will be a down year, given a smartphone market that is already in decline, we are reducing our fiscal-2019 estimates accordingly and set our 12-month price target to $200, down from $204. Salesforce.com \u2022 CRM Outperform \u2022 Price $126.88 on May 29 by Macquarie Research The developer and marketer of cloud-based enterprise computing reported a strong start to the year, with first-quarter 2019 revenues up 25%, year over year. International strength and marketing cloud momentum were highlights, and core execution was strong across all cloud segments, enabling the company to raise fiscal-year 2019 revenue estimates ahead of consensus estimates. Following this strong start to the year, we reiterate our Outperform rating and raise our target price from $150 to $157. Our target price is derived from our discounted cash flow, and yields 7.7 times fiscal-year 2020 estimated enterprise value to sales, and 32.8 times fiscal-year 2020\u2019s estimated enterprise value to free cash flow, versus the consensus estimate of six times fiscal-year 2020 estimated EV/sales and 25.7 times fiscal year 2020 estimated EV/FCF and versus the growth software group at 7.8 times and 41.9 times, respectively. Analog Devices \u2022 ADI-Nasdaq Outperform \u2022 Price $92.10 on May 30 by Raymond James We reiterate our Outperform rating on Analog and maintain our $105 price target. The company posted a solid report and guidance, consistent with commentary we\u2019ve heard from others in the advanced semiconductor signaling and streaming markets. We continue to believe that Analog possesses a tailwind to its estimates, based on a recovery in its communications business and continued strength in industrial applications. We also see some potential for multiple expansion, as it continues to delever in second-half 2018, which is likely to be followed by some capital return to investors. As favorable industry conditions continue\u2014for which our conviction is steadily increasing\u2014we continue to see catalysts that can move the stock higher. We adjust our fiscal-2019 non-GAAP earnings-per-share estimate to $5.84 from $5.62, reflecting high-teens top-line growth, modestly higher gross margin assumptions, and improved operating leverage. For 2019, our estimate is $5.84, based on mid-single digit sales growth, stable margins, and a return to the normalized tax rate (with higher rates on foreign earnings). Our unchanged $105 price target is based on an 18 times multiple on fiscal-2019 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $5.84, at the low end of peer multiples. We also expect multiple expansion as the debt from [Analog\u2019s] 2017 acquisition of Linear is paid down, and the headwinds of doing business with Apple are no longer an issue. We think it\u2019s likely that Analog will achieve its debt target over the next two quarters, at which point we expect a resumption of buybacks. Huntington Bancshares \u2022 HBAN-Nasdaq In Line \u2022 Price $14.44 on May 29 by Evercore ISI We hosted a webinar last week with Rich Porrello, president of auto finance at Huntington Bancshares. This report includes key takeaways from our discussion. Banks (and nonbank players) grew their auto-loan portfolios at a solid clip coming out of the 2008 crisis, as low interest rates and improving consumer spending boosted auto loan demand. But over the past two to three years, auto loans have begun to \u201cseason,\u201d as delinquencies and losses have risen. This, coupled with intense competition, has pressured returns in the business, driving certain banks to pull back in prime auto loans. Regulators are also increasingly wary of potential stress in the subprime segment, as evidenced by a recent Federal Reserve letter citing \u201chigher stressed-loss assumptions\u201d for subprime auto in 2018 CCAR (the Fed\u2019s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review of banks). Auto loan growth is expected to remain steady following recent moderation, but higher gas prices and borrowing costs could affect demand over time. Positively, Huntington remains one of the better-positioned players to capitalize on the disruption, and our price target stands at $16.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. prides itself on selling devices rather than relying on ads. Now the iPhone maker is looking to expand its digital-advertising business, people familiar with the matter said, as it shifts its growth strategy beyond selling devices toward pushing services on them. Over the past year, Apple has met with Snap Inc., Pinterest Inc. and other companies about participating in an Apple network that would distribute ads across their collective apps, the people said. Apple would share revenue with the apps displaying the ads, with the split varying from app to app, they said. The move would expand on Apple\u2019s current small-but-growing business selling promotional ads for search terms in its App Store, which delivered nearly $1 billion in revenue last year, they said. Under the concept discussed internally and raised with potential partners, users searching in Pinterest\u2019s app for \u201cdrapes\u201d might turn up an ad distributed by Apple for an interior-design app, or Snap users searching for \u201cNFL\u201d might see an ad for a ticket-reseller app, one of the people said. It\u2019s unclear where Apple\u2019s planning for the possible ad network stands. Representatives for Apple, Snap and Pinterest declined to comment. The digital ad effort, if it proceeds, would push Apple into territory dominated by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which claims 35% of the mobile ad market, and Facebook Inc., which has 25%, according to research firm eMarketer. Tech giants increasingly are elbowing into each other\u2019s turf seeking new sources of growth. Google launched its high-end Pixel smartphone in 2016 to compete with the iPhone. And Facebook is pushing into hardware with plans for a smart speaker that would compete with Apple\u2019s HomePod, Google Home and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s suite of Alexa-powered Echo speakers, according to a person familiar with the project. Google tools such as AdMob, AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange let marketers promote their products or services across a network of mobile apps, as well as online. Google typically takes about 30% of ad sales and the rest goes to the publisher, the company says. With smartphone sales broadly stagnating and iPhone growth slowing, Apple has begun looking to its services business\u2014which includes App Store sales, music-streaming subscriptions and mobile payments\u2014to drive growth. Its App Store ad business was a small fraction of its total services revenue of $29.98 billion, or about 13% of Apple\u2019s total sales, in the fiscal year ended September 2017. Apple aims to grow services revenue to about $50 billion by 2020. Competing with Google and Facebook wouldn\u2019t be easy, in part because they build detailed user profiles that marketers can use to more effectively target ads. Apple has criticized that extensive use of data for advertising, saying it effectively turns the customer into the product. \u201cThe truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a television interview on MSNBC in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected not to do that.\u201d For its App Store advertising, Apple says it collects information such as name, address, age, gender, device use, app activity and music, video or book downloads. It uses that data to create groups of people for targeted ads, such as 18- to 34-year-old men using an iPhone. It doesn\u2019t collect personal data from tools like Maps and Siri to use for advertising. Apple is \u201cthe most constrained when it comes to collecting and using user data,\u201d said Karsten Weide, a digital-advertising analyst with researcher International Data Corp. \u201cIf they got back in the ad business for good, they would be super-handicapped compared with Google and Facebook.\u201d Apple failed in its last advertising push. Its iAd service, launched in 2010, sold ads within mobile apps on iPhones and iPads but failed to catch on because it charged higher prices than competitors and restricted the types of ads marketers ran. Apple shut iAd in 2016. Todd Teresi, who oversees the ad business, refocused on the App Store ad business. While the business is small, its wide profit margins and strong performance have drawn attention from Mr. Cook and Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, a person close to Mr. Teresi said. Syndicating ads across many of the more than two million apps available in the App Store is a natural progression, the people said. Apple recently rehired one of the architects of its syndicated iAd network, Winston Crawford, whose LinkedIn page says he now runs global business development for Apple\u2019s ad platforms. He was most recently at Drawbridge Inc., which helps companies target ads at consumers across multiple devices. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult race for them to catch up on, but they have to start somewhere,\u201d said Raj Aggarwal, co-founder of Localytics, a mobile-app analytics company. \u201cIt can add billions in revenue and add to their valuation as they try to transform themselves into more of a services business.\u201d \u2014Eliot Brown contributed to this article.",

        "content": "These reports, excerpted and edited by Barron\u2019s, were issued recently by investment and research firms. The reports are a sampling of analysts\u2019 thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron\u2019s. Some of the reports\u2019 issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed. Apple \u2022 AAPL-Nasdaq Buy \u2022 Price $186.44 on May 15 by Canaccord Genuity Based on work for our North America survey, we believe the iPhone maintained its leading market share at all four major U.S. carriers\u2014AT&T, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile US, and Sprint\u2014and its overall share was probably greater than 50%. Further, we believe Apple\u2019s ecosystem approach, including its installed base of over 1.3 billion devices globally, will contribute to strong ongoing growth in services revenue. We expect higher-margin services-revenue growth will continue outpacing total company growth. We also think Apple is likely to launch three new iPhones in September\u2014possibly with lower price points. Greater segmentation could lead to year-over-year unit growth in 2019. We also see Apple continuing to grow its leading market share in premium-tier smartphones. We reiterate our Buy rating and $208 price target. Home Depot \u2022 HD-NYSE Outperform \u2022 Price $187.98 on May 15 by Raymond James We reaffirm our rating and our $215 target on the home construction and improvement retailer following its fiscal first-quarter 2018 earnings results. Admittedly, the quarterly numbers were disappointing, as comps missed consensus for the first time since HD\u2019s fiscal second-quarter 2016. That said, weather in the northern U.S. (HD\u2019s biggest division) was challenging. We don\u2019t believe there has been a change to the favorable fundamentals (housing formation, home-price appreciation, home affordability, housing turnover, and an aging housing stock). Therefore, we were buyers on Tuesday\u2019s [May 15] weakness, and we continue to see upside in Home Depot shares. Target \u2022 TGT-NYSE Buy \u2022 Price $73.08 on May 15 by MKM Partners We\u2019re a bit below the Street in how we see the retailer\u2019s comps and earnings per share but think the more aggressive Street numbers (at the higher ends of guided ranges) are doable, even with the likely negative impact from wintry weather in the East on sales of seasonal merchandise, including apparel. We also expect another quarter of strong digital sales\u2014up nearly 30% in fourth-quarter 2017\u2014driven in part by its growing effective fulfillment operations. We continue to view Target\u2019s 1,800-plus stores as a competitive advantage as it expands same-day delivery via Shipt (the web-based grocery delivery company it acquired in late 2017) throughout 2018. The company is taking a market-by-market approach with rollouts and, by our count, has expanded into nearly 30 states across the South, Southwest, Northwest, New England, and mid-Atlantic. A number of big states are still to come, including California, New York, and Illinois. Our 2% comp estimate for fiscal 2018 doesn\u2019t assume much lift from new fulfillment options, but this is probably conservative, as we believe that the early read on Shipt, Target Restock, Drive Up, and other delivery-based initiatives has been very positive. US Foods Holding \u2022 USFD-NYSE Overweight \u2022 Price $34.07 on May 14 by Morgan Stanley Research We have increased conviction that the food distributor\u2019s margin initiatives are poised to accelerate growth, and that its differentiated positioning offers it the greatest EPS growth potential in the industry. Unjustified valuation discount to peers and a highly attractive rate of return prompt our upgrade from Equal Weight to Overweight. We\u2019re also increasing US Foods \u2019 price target to $43 from $40. Overall, we see three key points. First, we expect top-line acceleration to be at mid-single digit percentage increases (from low-single digit averages in the past five years) versus the more stable but slower growth at peers. In particular, we are anticipating strong penetration in the high-margin, high-growth independent restaurant market, US Foods\u2019 core customer. We also remain bullish on US Foods\u2019 industry-leading e-commerce platform and its potential for ongoing tuck-in mergers-and-acquisitions deals. Second, the US Foods story has shifted: Since we initiated coverage in 2016, it has been an early-innings \u201cshow me\u201d margin-inflection story. Following four consecutive quarters of expense leveraging, it is now positioned to accelerate SG&A expenditures and achieve gross margin expansion (beginning in the second half of 2018), as execution on initiatives shows sustained results. We think investor and Street estimates are discounting this likelihood despite strong early progress. And third, we expect US Foods to generate significant cash, which we think will provide returns of capital, and probably a floor for the stock price. We also see it increasing its free cash flow by 23% from 2017 to 2020 to approximately $650 million, and we expect excess cash to be used in a mix of M&A ($200 million annually post-2018), debt pay-downs (averaging $300 million annually), and share buybacks (starting in 2019).

Apple \u2022 AAPL-Nasdaq Overweight \u2022 Price $169.10 on May 1 by Morgan Stanley Research Acceleration in services growth headlined a better-than-expected quarter and better-than-expected guidance. Even if smartphone replacement cycles continue to lengthen, we see Apple delivering 4% revenue growth and 16% EPS growth over the next three years, with services the primary growth engine. Significant inventory build in a tight commodity environment and with slowing smartphone growth is creating more noise than typical throughout the smartphone supply chain. On our updated estimates, slightly lower fiscal 2018 iPhone units (-1% year over year) and higher average unit sale prices, or ASPs (+14% Y/Y) deliver the strongest iPhone revenue growth since fiscal 2015. This is slightly better than the -3% Y/Y iPhone units and +12% Y/Y iPhone ASPs we modeled heading into the print. Flattish iPhone units and slightly declining iPhone ASPs over the next few years translates to total device (iPhone plus iPad plus Mac) revenue down by low single digits. This assumes replacement cycles continue to lengthen and allows the powerful growth in its services business (+31% Y/Y in March) to shine through in results. Net, our fiscal 2018 EPS increases to $11.41 from $11, and fiscal 2019 EPS is largely unchanged at $13.76. With more-predictable, higher-margin services revenue driving the model going forward, we see AAPL\u2019s multiple expanding, with our $200 price target implying 14.5 times our fiscal year 2019 EPS. Boeing \u2022 BA-NYSE Hold \u2022 Price $329.54 on May 1 by Canaccord Genuity Boeing announced plans to acquire KLX\u2019s (KLXI) Aerospace Solutions Group (a supplier of airline parts and system components, as well as cabin and passenger services) for $63/share in cash and approximately $1 billion of net debt. This implies an equity value of $3.25 billion and enterprise value of $4.25 billion. The acquisition price implies trailing fiscal year 2017 and forward year fiscal 2018 (pre-synergy and tax benefits) adjusted Ebitda multiples of 15.7 times and 14.3 times, respectively. This transaction is conditional upon the spinoff of KLX\u2019s Energy Services Group business to shareholders (and customary closing conditions) and is expected to close in third-quarter 2018. We like this transaction for Boeing because it accelerates the push into services, is very complementary to the existing Boeing services businesses, and brings in a company in KLX that has a very strong reputation and \u201cbest-in-class\u201d distribution business. Although Boeing currently provides aviation and related parts to a range of airlines and other customers through its Aviall business, ASG\u2019s portfolio has little overlap and allows Boeing to expand offerings, to cross-sell products and value-added services, and to become a more complete one-stop shop. Additionally, as of January 2018, KLX reportedly invested heavily (more than $100 million) in its proprietary systems to support distribution processes, part attributes, customer services, and other services. KLX ASG will add roughly $1.4 billion in revenue, with approximately $600 million for the aftermarket. KLX ASG will also bring significant opportunities to save costs through the original equipment supply chain in both the commercial and defense sides of the business. We are maintaining our Hold rating and $350 price target for Boeing. While we like the KLX-ASG acquisition, and we believe the services push for Boeing represents a significant opportunity to create value, we believe the near-term free cash flow is largely already reflected in the stock. We also see risk that the commercial cycle is closer to peaking than had been expected, but for now we believe it remains healthy. Mastercard \u2022 MA-NYSE Hold \u2022 Price $180.25 on May 1 by Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners Mastercard\u2019s core EPS of $1.50 was 25 cents above consensus and 29 cents above our $1.21 forecast. The beat relative to our forecast was driven by higher net revenue, as the three major revenue lines (domestic assessments, transaction processing fees, and cross-border fees) all exceeded our forecast. GAAP EPS of $1.41 includes the negative impact of $117 million for three different litigation provisions. Management is increasing its 2018 organic net revenue guidance to \u201cmidteens\u201d from the \u201chigh end of low-double digits.\u201d While this is a positive, the offset appears to be organic expense guidance rising to \u201chigh-single digit\u201d from \u201cmid-single digit.\u201d Organic growth excludes the impact from (1) acquisitions, (2) revenue recognition rules effective in 2018, and (3) Mastercard\u2019s contribution to a philanthropy it sponsors, the Center for Inclusive Growth. In addition, rebates and incentives were below our model. Net revenue of $3.580 billion beat our forecast by $340 million, or 26 cents in EPS. Our 12-month price target stands unchanged at $182, which we arrive at by applying a 30-times multiple to our 2018 EPS estimate of $6.05.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% flexed its financial muscle with a record $100 billion plan to buy back stock from investors, as it reported strong gains in revenue and profit even as growth in the number of iPhones sold remained weak. The results for Apple\u2019s fiscal second quarter reflect a fundamental transformation reshaping the world\u2019s most valuable company, turning a business centered on how many devices it ships into one built around high-end features and services for those devices. Apple\u2019s report Tuesday capped a string of strong earnings from U.S. tech giants including Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., and Facebook Inc., all of which continued to thrive despite business challenges and rising concern from regulators, politicians and others about the technology industry\u2019s power and practices. On average, the four companies saw their revenue rise 28% in the first three months from a year ago. Revenue from the iPhone, which still accounts for most of Apple\u2019s sales and profit, rose 14% to $38 billion in the quarter, which ended in March. That came despite a modest 3% increase in the number of iPhones shipped, thanks to higher average prices driven by the $1,000 iPhone X launched last year. Apple further assuaged concerns about its future with a forecast for total revenue in the current quarter of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, which would represent a healthy increase from a year ago. Meanwhile, Apple said the number of paid subscriptions for services ranging from HBO to Apple Music rose to 270 million in the period, an increase of 100 million people in a year. Revenue from the services business jumped by nearly a third to $9.19 billion, accelerating from the previous quarter. The combination drove total revenue up 16% to $61.14 billion in the latest period, Apple said. Profit rose 25% to $13.82 billion, its highest level for a March quarter. \u201cWith the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think that this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we\u2019re on,\u201d Chief Executive Tim Cook said during a call with analysts. Apple\u2019s $100 billion share-repurchase plan is the largest ever announced by a U.S. company, according to data from research firm Birinyi Associates. Apple said its board also approved a 16% increase in its quarterly dividend. That put it on track to spend $14.82 billion a year in dividends, making it the largest dividend payer, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple already had paid out $275 billion to shareholders through March since it resumed returning capital to them in 2012, including $200 billion in share repurchases.

Source: Birinyi Associates (biggest buybacks); S&P Dow Jones Indices The increase in Apple\u2019s capital return comes after it announced in January it would bring the majority of its $269 billion in overseas cash holdings back to the U.S. That followed the major U.S. tax overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law late last year, which requires companies to pay a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash. Apple didn\u2019t give a timetable for implementing the new buybacks. Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that given the size of the planned buybacks \u201cit\u2019s going to take us some time to execute,\u201d but \u201cour plan is to do it at a fast pace.\u201d Sluggish growth in the number of iPhones shipped over the past six months has fueled investor concerns about the outlook for Apple\u2019s marquee business, as people hold on to smartphones longer and competition from homegrown rivals intensifies in China, once its fastest-growing market. Apple\u2019s stock has stalled this year, after investors sent its share price up 45% last year on hopes that the feature-rich X model would help recharge growth. The device\u2019s price tag has damped demand, say analysts, who now expect another year of low, single-digit growth in the number of iPhones Apple ships. Apple shares closed at $169.10 on Tuesday ahead of the earnings report, even as shares in other tech giants including Amazon Inc. have continued to rise. The shares rose more than 3% in after-hours trading. \u201cThe high end of the smartphone market where Apple is dominant is very mature,\u201d said Arif Karim, a senior investment analyst at Ensemble Capital Management, a Burlingame, Calif., wealth manager that counts Apple among its largest holdings. He said the huge shipment increases the iPhone once enjoyed are \u201cdead.\u201d The price tag for the iPhone X, though, has counteracted that. Apple\u2019s revenue forecast of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for the current quarter is on track with analysts\u2019 recent consensus estimate of $51.9 billion, a number that has fallen in recent weeks as Apple suppliers such as Broadcom Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. warned of slowing smartphone sales world-wide. Growth in China, which cratered in 2016 after soaring the year before, continued to accelerate. Sales in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, rose 21% to $13 billion. Mr. Cook played down concerns about recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China, saying he was optimistic that the U.S. and China can find a way to that both can win economically and grow the global pie, \u201cnot just allocate it differently.\u201d The services business has become one of Apple\u2019s biggest growth engines, with revenue in its last fiscal year rising 23% to $30 billion. Apple aims to lift that number to $50 billion by 2020. The company has 1.3 billion iPhones and other devices in active use and earns an estimated $30 per device on music subscriptions, app store purchases and other services, according to Morgan Stanley, which expects services to account for about 60% of Apple\u2019s revenue growth over the next five years. The division that includes Apple\u2019s smartwatches and AirPods wireless earbuds also posted another period of strong gains, with sales rising 38% to $3.95 billion in the period. \u201cThey are reinventing the growth story,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, vice president at Synovus Trust Company, which has $14 billion under management and counts Apple among its largest holdings. \u201cThey see the iPhone numbers like everyone else does and know they have to grow other aspects of their business.\u201d",

        "content": "BRUSSELS\u2014European Union antitrust authorities on Monday opened a full-blown probe into Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s proposed acquisition of song-recognition app Shazam Entertainment Ltd. on concerns it would reduce choice for users of music-streaming services. The deal would give Apple ownership of a popular app that helps users identify songs, before directing them to Apple Music or Spotify to listen to and potentially buy or stream the music. It also would give Apple access to extensive information on consumers\u2019 musical interests. Financial terms of the deal, announced in December, weren\u2019t disclosed. The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s antitrust authority, said it was concerned Apple would gain access to data that would allow the iPhone maker to directly target its rivals\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to its music-subscription service, Apple Music. EU investigators said they would also probe whether competitors could be harmed if Apple were to discontinue referrals to their services from the Shazam app. \u201cOur investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger,\u201d EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday. The EU could block the deal or extract concessions from the companies in exchange for clearance. Apple didn\u2019t comment. London-based Shazam said, \u201cWe respect the European Commission\u2019s process and look forward to having the acquisition closed,\u201d adding \u201cwe can\u2019t imagine a better home for Shazam.\u201d Control of data and large sets of personal information is playing an increasingly important role in the EU\u2019s antitrust and merger reviews. The bloc\u2019s regulators are scrutinizing whether companies holding large amounts of data can use it to cut costs or gain customers in a way that thwarts new competitors. The EU is also considering changing its merger review rules to include a wider swath of technology deals not typically within its purview, such as the acquisition of a company that generates relatively little revenue but holds commercially valuable data. Referrals from Shazam could help Apple raise the number of subscribers to its streaming-music service to better compete with competitors. They include Spotify AB, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in early April and Tencent Music Entertainment Group, China\u2019s largest music-streaming company, which is preparing what would be one of the biggest technology IPOs ever, say people familiar with the matter. Apple initially registered the Shazam deal with regulators in Austria, but authorities there, along with those in France, Italy, Sweden and several other EU countries, asked Brussels to review the deal instead. The national authorities were concerned the deal could harm competition across the European market as well as within their borders. The European Commission said in February it would take over the review of the merger from Austria. Then on Monday, the EU said it would undertake a full-blown review given lingering concerns. Such a process allows companies several more months to suggest steps, such as selling assets, to win over regulators. The EU has jurisdiction over a merger if the companies have combined annual world-wide revenue of \u20ac5 billion ($6.1 billion) and each has \u20ac250 million in revenue within the EU as a whole. Apple\u2019s acquisition of Shazam doesn\u2019t meet those revenue thresholds; the app in 2016 posted revenue of about \u00a340 million ($56.2 million). But national regulators or companies are allowed to ask the commission to make an exception The EU said it was giving itself until Sept. 4 to decide on the deal, though the deadline could still be extended.",

        "content": "If you upgraded your iPhone to iOS 11.3, which rolled out over the past week or so, look at the Battery section of Settings, under a new menu called Battery Health. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find crucial information about the health and longevity of your phone. It also gives you the ability to prevent your phone from being slowed down due to poor battery health. The new feature, still in the potentially buggy beta stage, appears months after Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% came under fire for slowing down (aka throttling) older iPhones without disclosing the practice to users. Battery Health begins with a measure of your phone battery\u2019s maximum capacity, its ability to hold a charge compared with its original state. Over time, lithium-ion batteries store less power each time they charge, and can degrade based on how often you charge the phone, the temperature at which you store it and other factors. The lower that percentage, the shorter your battery life. Shorter battery life corresponds with a higher susceptibility to unexpected crashes, says Apple. This was the root of its rationale for throttling. In my testing, on a nearly new iPhone X, the battery\u2019s maximum capacity was still 100%, while another I checked was already at 98%. A year-old iPhone 7 showed 99%, and a three-year-old iPhone 6S was down to 93%. Two iPhone SEs displayed 87% and 86%. The second section of Battery Health is Peak Performance Capability, which informs users whether their device is being throttled. The best news you\u2019ll get here is, \u201cYour battery is currently supporting normal peak performance.\u201d When you update to iOS 11.3, you\u2019re likely to see it. Apple says the throttling software, known as \u201cperformance management,\u201d will be initially disabled, but \u201cit will be reenabled if the device subsequently experiences an unexpected shutdown.\u201d If that happens, you\u2019ll see a message saying, \u201cPerformance management has been applied to help prevent this from happening again.\u201d Apple says the throttling applies to iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and SE models. Apple says the newer iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X are designed to manage power better to avoid crashes. You can disable performance management and go back to using your phone as normal\u2014though Apple says that increases the chances of another crash, at which point the throttling software will again automatically activate. You can also leave the management to its business, and get used to your slightly slower iPhone. Or you can replace your battery. The Battery Health page begins recommending you do so once your maximum capacity dips below about 80%. You can get a new battery for an iPhone 6 or later at any Apple store for $29 through the end of 2018. Once you\u2019ve replaced your battery, it will go back to working at full blast.",

        "content": "When smartphones came to steal our attention, we never had a chance. Even in the rare moments we manage to put them down, they buzz incessantly, begging us to come back. It\u2019s fine for phones to be engrossing when we\u2019re bored on a layover. More often they should help us work or exercise or find a Starbucks, then get out of the way. Now, more than a decade into the smartphone era, investors, activists and customers alike have begun to push phone makers, especially Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% to find a way to solve phone addiction. The feature we need already exists: It\u2019s called Do Not Disturb. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you have a one-tap way to shut your phone up. Do Not Disturb should be every smartphone user\u2019s best friend and saving grace. Instead, it\u2019s a relic of a long-gone era, a feature that doesn\u2019t work the way we do. Apple launched Do Not Disturb in 2012 to keep your phone from waking you up in the middle of the night. When you tap the moon icon, your phone instantly shuts up. Your notifications are visible if you wake up your phone, but it won\u2019t buzz or light up automatically. There are only small nuances: You can name contacts who can call you\u2014no texts get through when Do Not Disturb is engaged\u2014or allow anyone who calls twice to buzz through on the second call. Last year, the company launched Do Not Disturb While Driving, which engages when your phone connects to your car stereo or its motion sensors detect driving. It allows alarms and timers\u2014and Apple Maps navigation\u2014but generally keeps the screen dark. Anyone who messages you can receive an automatic response. The problem is that this dichotomy\u2014you\u2019re either on or off, zero or 100\u2014doesn\u2019t actually represent how people use their phones. When you\u2019re sleeping, you might want total quiet. But what about at work, when you\u2019re still reachable but trying to focus on your presentation instead of incessant ESPN updates? Or when the people you care most about would rather use WhatsApp or Snapchat, instead of calling you? Turning on Do Not Disturb is like taking your landline phone off the hook to keep it from ringing. Do Not Disturb should have a sort of volume meter, from 0 to 10. When you\u2019re bored on the couch, turn the knob all the way up and let the distracting notifications flow. When you\u2019re asleep go to 0: silence is golden. In between, users ought to be able to control what gets through and when. At work you need buzzes for your calendar, email and Slack, but would rather not have Candy Crush luring you back in before lunchtime. There should be an \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting\u201d setting, and a \u201cGet me out of this meeting\u201d one, too. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google does this better. Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb, launched in 2014, has a Total Silence mode, but also offers Priority Mode. With that engaged, only the apps you\u2019ve handpicked can buzz your phone. My friends can message me on all the apps I use, but Starbucks can\u2019t tell me about deals, and Twitter can\u2019t suck me back into my timeline. Android also allows you to let calendar notifications or reminders through the Do Not Disturb wall. Google could do more; Apple could do much more. Users should be able to set their own rules. Studies have shown that when people reduce notifications, they worry they\u2019re missing important things. By ensuring you\u2019re seeing the things that matter, and shutting up the (many, many more) things that don\u2019t, Do Not Disturb could address this. At the same time, Android and iOS should begin automatically managing your phone\u2019s distractions. They could differentiate between morning and evening, weekend and weekdays. Android can engage Do Not Disturb in sync with your calendar events, but it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re bored in the dentist\u2019s waiting room or stressing in a job interview. Devices could use their knowledge of your location, calendar and activity to figure out exactly how much you can be bothered. Apple and Google are the only companies in a position to make this work at the system level. Third-party developers can\u2019t access the control they\u2019d need, across apps and services, to regulate the whole system. (And would you want them to?) One app, Flipd, can temporarily remove distracting apps from your phone, but \u201cthis is not something Apple makes it easy for us to do,\u201d said Alanna Harvey, one of the app\u2019s co-founders. Even the setup is enough to scare people away, though Ms. Harvey says it\u2019s the app\u2019s most popular feature \u201conce people get over the hump.\" Google and Apple say they\u2019re working on improvements to Do Not Disturb, though both declined to provide specific plans. Spokesmen for both companies also pointed to notification controls as another way to manage your influx. I don\u2019t see it that way. Certainly, you should control which apps can notify you and how, but there\u2019s no \u201cwhen\u201d notification setting. What users really need is an easy way to receive notifications from partners, bosses and close friends\u2014and from any app. Why constantly tweak each app\u2019s notifications? We should be able to make the rules once, with one tool, and not worry about it again.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. said it is updating its entry-level iPad with capabilities designed to appeal to students and new software for teachers, as the company tries to recharge sales of the tablet and shore up its dwindling share of the U.S. education market. The company Tuesday said its new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and works with the Apple Pencil stylus, which previously worked only with higher-end iPad Pro models. The entry-level iPad\u2019s price remains at $329, the lowest-priced tablet available from the company. Schools, which receive discounts on pricing, can buy the device for $299. The announcement, held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, was coupled with software and support capabilities aimed at schools. They included more free cloud storage, a management system to assist schools with creating Apple IDs for students and a cloud-based app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to monitor students\u2019 progress on assignments. The kindergarten-through-12 market represents a critical opportunity for tech companies to get young people accustomed to their operating systems. Introducing students to those systems could help sway future purchasing decisions that span the rest of their lives, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University. \u201cThe moment you get someone on your ecosystem, and they become fluent in your operating system, the switching costs become very real,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. A lot of consumers start on Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating system and never switch, \u201cso it\u2019s logical to lock them in early,\u201d he said. Technology companies have been pushing computers and other devices into the classroom since at least the 1970s, and Apple took an early lead with its easy-to-use operating system. But the company\u2019s dominance faded in the face of cheaper laptop options such as Google Chromebooks from Alphabet Inc. or Windows-powered devices from Microsoft Corp. While many of those devices cost less than $300, Apple\u2019s MacBook starts at $999. Apple\u2019s lowest-priced iPad, which got a $70 price cut last year, offers the company its best chance to compete in the cost-conscious education market. But the addition of a Pencil and a keyboard\u2014which are necessary to take many computer-administered tests and could add more than $150 to the price\u2014make the iPad a costlier option than rival low-priced laptops, said Ben Davis, a senior education analyst with Futuresource Consulting. Despite efforts by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to champion iPads as laptop replacements, iPad sales have fallen 40% from their peak in fiscal 2013 to $19.22 billion. Losing ground to Chromebooks and Windows devices in the classroom contributed to the iPad\u2019s struggles, said Frank Catalano, an independent education technology analyst with Intrinsic Strategy. The update to the entry level iPad is unlikely to reverse Apple\u2019s slump in education sales, analysts say. Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s share of computing shipments in the $18 billion U.S. education hardware market has fallen to 19% from 50%, according to Futuresource Consulting. Alphabet now has a 59% share, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 22%. In addition to competing on price, Alphabet and Microsoft devices have gained ground in classrooms by offering a strong mobile-device management system that helps IT departments block students from exiting a browser during a test, Mr. Davis said. Apple on Tuesday announced a system to enable students to share iPads, so they can log into any tablet and reach their own documents and apps. It said Apple\u2019s school management system would allow schools to create as many as 1,500 Apple IDs in minutes. The company also said it was expanding free iCloud storage for schools to 200 gigabytes from 5 GB. The new Schoolwork app is coupled with a developer platform called ClassKit that developers can use to create apps that teachers can assign to students. It also announced a new curriculum called \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d that allows teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking and photography into lessons. \u201cEducation is such a big part of who we are as a company and has been for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cTechnology can help teachers deliver a unique and personalized learning experience to all kids. We\u2019ve never stopped believing that.\u201d While the iPad remains popular with children and teachers, educators have expressed frustration that they must seek out curriculum apps, rather than getting a simple suite of apps as Google provides, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies. \u201cThey have done a lot on manageability, which will make a big difference\u201d for many schools, Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cWhile price has not changed for iPad, you get a lot more with it.\u201d",

Mr. Iovine is one of the last of a team of prominent music executives Apple gained when it bought Beats Electronics LLC in 2014 for $3 billion.

        "content": "PARIS\u2014France wants to fine Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% and Google for allegedly taking advantage of smaller French software developers, targeting two of the U.S.\u2019s biggest companies, as tensions heat up between the two continents after President Donald Trump said he would adopt new tariffs that could hit European firms. The French Finance Ministry said Wednesday it has filed a complaint asking a Paris court to order Apple and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., GOOG 0.03% to end \u201cabusive commercial practices\u201d following a three-year government investigation into how the Silicon Valley companies treat French start-ups that develop and sell applications for mobile phones. Some developers and publishers are unhappy that Apple and Google at times take a cut of in-app purchases and get access to more data on their users and subscribers than the developers do. \u201cNo matter how powerful Google and Apple may be, they cannot treat our start-ups and developers the way they do today,\u201d French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on French radio. \u201cWe believe our terms comply with French laws and are looking forward to making our case in court,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. The French finance ministry says there\u2019s no connection between taking on tech firms and the U.S.\u2019s new tariffs and taxes. However, France has recently become more vocal about its actions against U.S. firms. A finance ministry official said Europe \u201cneeds to stand up and defend its own interests.\u201d President Trump has said he would implement new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and the U.S. passed a tax overhaul that could hit European tech and pharmaceutical firms operating in the U.S. Each side has accused the other of protectionism, raising the specter of a trade war. Mr. Le Maire plans to speak with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross later Wednesday about the U.S. tariff plan and push for an exemption of the EU, according to the finance ministry official. Mr. Le Maire has been a prime agitator in other efforts to rein in the tech giants. The EU is considering levying a new tax on the revenue\u2014instead of the profit\u2014of tech giants. Mr. Le Maire and others argue that tech giants use legal loopholes to shift too much profit to tax havens, and that until laws can be changed to stamp out such practices, Europe must tax revenue instead. Mr. Le Maire said Wednesday he is pushing the EU to adopt the new tax this year. But it remains unclear whether the proposal can muster the unanimous support from EU countries that it needs to become law. Ireland, Luxembourg and other low-tax EU countries where many tech firms are headquartered have expressed opposition to the measure. The case France announced Wednesday seeks to address a \u201csignificant imbalance\u201d in the way Google and Apple treat developers, the finance ministry said, adding the government is seeking to fine each company two million euros. \u201cWhen our developers want to sell their app on Google or Apple, the fees are imposed on them,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s not the economy we want.\u201d",

        "content": "Apple Inc., AAPL 0.85% responding to U.S. Senate questions about its decision to slow performance on older iPhones, said it is considering rebates for battery replacements for some users affected by the issue. In a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee made public Tuesday, Apple said it may offer the rebates to customers who replaced their iPhone batteries before it slashed replacement fees by $50 late last year to address rising customer complaints about a software update that slowed the performance of older iPhones. The letter, dated Feb. 2, is the latest indication that Apple continues to look for ways to improve its response to the iPhone slowdown after scrutiny from customers and regulators. The letter was sent in response to a questions sent to Apple last month by Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, who asked Apple, among other things, if it would consider providing rebates. In December, Apple said it had throttled back the performance of older iPhones to prevent devices from automatically powering off because of weak batteries. Some customers and analysts speculated that Apple was using the slowdown to pressure people to buy newer iPhones. Apple is facing probes over potential security violations in its handling of the issue from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as investigations in Europe and questions from at least one consumer group in China. The tech giant has apologized for how it handled the issue, and said that it would never intentionally shorten the life of its products or degrade performance to drive customers to upgrade. The company slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79.\u200b\u200b Apple declined to comment Tuesday about when it will make a final decision about rebates for customers who replaced older batteries before that price cut. \u200b Apple\u2019s critics have questioned how and when it notified customers of the software update. In its letter, Apple laid out the timeline for the software update last year that triggered customer complaints. The company said it made the update in January in the software update iOS 10.2.1 to address spontaneous shutdowns of some older iPhone devices. After evaluating the change\u2019s effectiveness, Apple said, it publicly disclosed the change in February with a note describing how the update \u201cimproves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns.\u201d The company said it also discussed the change with several media outlets. Apple\u2019s letter left some questions unclear. It didn\u2019t respond in detail to specific questions concerning how many customers have complained to Apple about the slowdown. The company also was vague about whether it had used similar performance-management software with previous generations of iPhones. The company said only that those phones \u201chave different system power demands\u201d and \u201cdid not experience the same issues.\u201d",

        "content": "BRUSSELS\u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam Entertainment Ltd. may adversely impact competition in Europe, European Union antitrust authorities said Tuesday, announcing they would take over the merger review from national regulators in Austria. The move fits with a broader strategy by the EU to more closely scrutinize mergers involving data-rich companies, but whose revenue falls below traditional thresholds that determine whether a deal merits a review by EU authorities. Top EU officials often stress the value of data in the marketplace as a \u201cnew form of currency.\u201d Apple said in December it would acquire the UK-based developer at a time when the iPhone maker is looking to boost its music-subscription service. The deal would give Apple ownership of an app that helps users identify unfamiliar songs. It also would give the company access to extensive data and insight on people\u2019s musical interests. Financial terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Apple initially registered the deal with regulators in Austria, but the EU said it had concluded that regulators in Brussels were \u201cthe best placed authority to deal with the potential cross-border effects of the transaction.\u201d Apple now has to register the deal in Brussels. Austria, France, Italy, Sweden and several other EU countries asked Brussels to take over the review on concerns the deal could harm competition in their member states as well as impact trade within the European market. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s competition regulator, have been at loggerheads over the EU\u2019s decision in 2016 to order the smartphone maker to pay Ireland \u20ac13 billion ($16.2 billion) in allegedly unpaid taxes. Both Ireland and Apple are appealing the decision. The probe into the Shazam acquisition comes as the EU is considering changing its merger review rules to include a wider swath of technology deals that normally wouldn\u2019t fall within its purview, such as a merger involving an acquired company that generates relatively little revenue but holds commercially valuable data. The commission, which has the power to block deals or seek concessions like the sale of certain assets, only has jurisdiction over a merger if the companies have combined annual world-wide revenue of \u20ac5 billion and each has \u20ac250 million in revenue within the EU as a whole. Apple\u2019s acquisition of Shazam doesn\u2019t meet those traditional revenue thresholds but national regulators or companies are allowed to ask the commission to make an exception. Shazam in 2016 posted revenues of about \u00a340 million ($56.2 million), up from about \u00a335 million in 2015. The commission has been considering the new rules after Facebook Inc. paid roughly $22 billion for WhatsApp\u2014a deal that was eventually cleared unconditionally by the EU in 2014. The commission wasn\u2019t expected to review the deal because the messaging app doesn\u2019t have sufficient revenue in the region. But Facebook asked the commission for a single review that would cover the 28-nation bloc, rather than face the possibility of separate reviews in three or more EU countries. \u2014Sam Schechner contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know. EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings of $3.86 a share is the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared with $3.36 a share a year ago. The company hasn\u2019t provided earnings guidance for the quarter but in November said it expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5% in the quarter. REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $87.06 billion is expected by analysts, compared with $78.4 billion reported a year earlier. In November, Apple said it expected revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion in the quarter. Dollars & Cents: Apple raised prices last year in a move that has the potential to boost overall revenue even as the number of iPhones it sells stagnates. Analysts believe the strategy paid off in December. Apple is projected to report a 1.5% increase in iPhone shipments, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, but the $1,000 iPhone X, released on Nov. 3, is expected to lift the average selling price of the device 9% to $755. Those higher prices are expected to lift iPhone revenue 10% to $60 billion in the period. Meanwhile, Apple kept more old iPhone models on the market in December, a move that market research firm Strategy Analytics predicts helped the company increase iPhone shipments 22% in China. Taxman: Apple in mid-January announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes on the $252 billion it holds overseas, but it hasn\u2019t said how much of that money it will bring back to the U.S. or outlined what will be returned to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. The company typically announces capital return plans in April or May and may hold off discussing it until then. But expect analysts to ask for more clarity on Apple\u2019s plans now that it no longer needs to hold cash overseas to avoid paying higher U.S. taxes. Also, look for the company to update its new effective tax rate. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to benefit from a lower tax rate of approximately 15.9% due to tax reform, adding $1.13 to its current fiscal-year earnings per share Promised Land: Analysts and investors will zero in on Apple\u2019s revenue projections for the March quarter. With the iPhone X contributing less than two months of sales during the last quarter, many analysts had banked on strong sales in the current period because of pent up demand. Some have scuttled those projections recently amid reports that iPhone manufacturing has slowed. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein reduced his projections for the current quarter to 53 million units from 66 million and warned the earnings call could trigger downward earnings estimates for the period. Analysts currently project revenue for the March quarter of $66.54 billion, according to FactSet. The Great Divide: Apple doesn\u2019t break out its mix of iPhone sales by model, forcing analysts and investors to come up with their own estimates. One of the key indicators of demand is channel inventory. Apple tries to keep inventory in the five- to seven-week range. UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said that if the iPhone X is a disappointment relative to Apple\u2019s expectations, then the company\u2019s inventory levels could be higher. During its last earnings call for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company indicated it expected healthy demand for the iPhone X by saying it increased inventory by 1.3 million smartphone units to support the iPhone 8 launch, 50% less than the 2.5 million it added during the release of the iPhone 7 in the same period a year earlier. Trouble No More: The company\u2019s business in China is showing signs of improvement. Sales rose in the September quarter from a year earlier, marking the first quarterly gain in more than a year. Analysts expect this quarter to deliver another increase with sales projected to rise 9.2% to $17.73 billion, according to FactSet. The growth is expected to be driven by improved iPhone sales in that market and the continued strength of App Store sales.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% said it would pay a one-time tax of $38 billion on its overseas cash holdings and ramp up spending in the U.S., as it seeks to emphasize its contributions to the American economy after years of taking criticism for outsourcing manufacturing to China. The world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company laid out its plans Wednesday in a statement that was full of big-dollar figures, though it said that much of the money reflected Apple\u2019s current pace of spending. VIEW Interactive Apple said it would invest $30 billion in capital spending in the U.S. over five years that would create more than 20,000 jobs. The total includes a new campus, which initially will house technical support for customers, and $10 billion toward data centers across the country. It also will expand from $1 billion to $5 billion a fund it established last year for investing in advanced manufacturing in the U.S. Apple\u2019s $38 billion tax commitment is the largest such sum announced in response to the major overhaul of the U.S. tax code that President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. That law included an incentive for U.S. companies to bring home offshore holdings, with companies required to pay a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. U.S. companies have long pushed for such a change to enable them to repatriate overseas cash without what they considered an excessive tax hit. Apple on Wednesday cited the tax changes as the reason for its $38 billion payment. It didn\u2019t say how much of its $252.3 billion in overseas cash holdings it plans to bring home, though it will be the vast majority, Chief Executive Tim Cook told ABC News in an interview. All told, Apple said it would directly contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, with the bulk\u2014about $55 billion this year, for example\u2014coming from ongoing spending on parts and services from U.S. suppliers. That number also includes the federal tax payment and capital spending. Mr. Cook touted the plans as building on Apple\u2019s support for the U.S. economy. \u201cWe have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible,\u201d he said in a statement. The company said in November that it had earmarked $36 billion to cover deferred taxes on that money, assuming that it would eventually pay U.S. taxes on a portion of it by bringing it home. Mr. Trump praised Apple\u2019s announcement on Twitter, saying his policies allowed the tech giant \u201cto bring massive amounts of money back to the United States.\u201d He added, \u201cHuge win for American workers and the USA!\u201d Apple didn\u2019t provide historical comparisons for some of the figures it gave Wednesday. The company previously said it planned $16 billion in capital expenditures world-wide in the fiscal year that ends this September, up from $14.9 billion the previous year. However, Apple doesn\u2019t break out its spending in the U.S., making it difficult to gauge how much of the $30 billion over five years it announced Wednesday is new. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said Apple\u2019s plans are in line with Trump administration goals, but it isn\u2019t clear how many of the commitments are new. And he said the company could deliver on those commitments with existing cash flow\u2014without needing to tap cash holdings. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice number and puts a foot forward in line with where the administration wants to go with adding jobs and building in the U.S.,\u201d he said. But \u201cit\u2019s not clear these investments were impacted in any way by tax reform.\u201d Apple has faced criticism over the past decade for overseas manufacturing of its iPhones, of which it has sold more than one billion, rather than making them domestically. Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign blasted the company for outsourcing. He later called on Apple to build a factory in the U.S. and last year said Mr. Cook promised to build three plants in the U.S. Apple also has been the poster child for parking overseas profits offshore, and U.S. lawmakers and others have claimed the company sought to avoid U.S. and international taxes\u2014a criticism Apple has strongly rejected. Apple has responded over the past year by pointing to its spending on procurement in the U.S. and to the size of the so-called app economy spawned by the iPhone, which the company says has created more than 1.6 million U.S. jobs. The tax overhaul\u2019s one-time levy on overseas cash is often referred to as a repatriation tax, although it applies whether companies leave their foreign profits overseas or bring them to the U.S. It is intended as a transition from the previous tax system, under which the U.S. taxed all world-wide profits of an American company except those kept overseas, to the new system, in which the U.S. won\u2019t tax most foreign profits at all. Companies may choose to pay the one-time tax over eight years. The $38 billion in taxes Apple owes reflects its growth in the decade since Congress last reduced taxes on overseas holdings. In 2006, Apple recorded a tax charge of $51 million as it repatriated $1.6 billion in cash held overseas for the fiscal year. Apple\u2019s accumulated foreign profits of $252.3 billion amount to just over a quarter of the U.S. tech industry\u2019s total, a Wall Street Journal analysis of 311 large public companies found, and about 9.5% of the $2.65 trillion in foreign profits reported by all companies in the analysis. A tax obligation of $38 billion would work out to about 15% of the S&P 500\u2019s total obligation under the repatriation tax, based on figures from the Journal analysis and a separate analysis by Zion Research Group. Altogether, the Joint Tax Committee estimated last month, the tax should raise about $339 billion over 10 years from all companies\u2014meaning Apple could account for 11% of the total. The changes in U.S. tax law triggering Apple\u2019s $38 billion tax obligation don\u2019t affect the company\u2019s responsibility to repay Ireland \u20ac13 billion ($15.9 billion) in unpaid taxes in Europe, according to a spokesman for Ireland\u2019s Department of Finance. Apple has challenged the ruling. Apple also told employees Wednesday it is issuing each of them a bonus of $2,500 in restricted stock, according to a person familiar with the matter. The planned bonus, reported earlier by Bloomberg, adds Apple to the growing list of companies that are rewarding employees due to the new tax law, including AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. If Apple brings home a large share of its overseas cash it could decide to apply some of it to more buybacks and dividends. Apple has returned $233.9 billion to investors since fiscal 2012. Mr. Sacconaghi expects Apple to provide an update on potential increases to those programs when it reports quarterly results in April or May, when it typically announces such plans. That would give it a chance to see how much cash other companies plan to return to shareholders from overseas holdings\u2014moves that could please investors but aren\u2019t as helpful to public perception as investments in jobs. \u201cNo company with that much cash wants to be the first to do a significant buyback,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s announcement said it currently employs 84,000 people in the U.S., 4,000 more than it said a year ago. The company said it would offer more information later this year on its planned new campus. The facility is expected to be located outside of California and Texas, where the company already operates campuses: in Austin, Texas, and its new $5 billion headquarters, Apple Park, in Cupertino, Calif. \u2014Theo Francis, Richard Rubin and Natalia Drozdiak contributed to this article.

        "content": "The iPhone has made Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible. A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction. Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health. Can families learn to live in harmony with technology? Join the conversation in our new Facebook group: Parenting in the Age of Tech The Apple push is a preamble to a new several-billion-dollar fund Jana is seeking to raise this year to target companies it believes can be better corporate citizens. It is the first instance of a big Wall Street activist seeking to profit from the kind of social-responsibility campaign typically associated with a small fringe of investors. Adding splash, rock star Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, will be on an advisory board along with Sister Patricia A. Daly, a nun who successfully fought Exxon Mobil Corp. over environmental disclosures, and Robert Eccles, an expert on sustainable investing. The Apple campaign would be unusual for an activist like Jana, which normally urges companies to make financial changes. But the investors believe that Apple\u2019s highflying stock could be hurt in coming decades if it faces a backlash and that proactive moves could generate goodwill and keep consumers loyal to Apple brands. \u201cApple can play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good business and the right thing to do,\u201d the shareholders wrote in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThere is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset, and no company can outsource that responsibility.\u201d Obsessive teenage smartphone usage has sparked a debate among academics, parents and even the people who helped create the iPhone. Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snap chat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life. Apple hasn\u2019t offered any public guidance to parents on how to manage children\u2019s smartphone use or taken a position on at what age they should begin using iPhones. Apple and its rivals point to features that give parents some measure of control. Apple, for instance, gives parents the ability to choose which apps, content and services their children can access. The basic idea behind socially responsible investing is that good corporate citizenship can also be good business. Big investors and banks, including TPG, UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are making bets on socially responsible companies, boosting what they see as good actors and avoiding bad ones. Big-name activists increasingly view bad environmental, social or governance policies as red flags. Jana plans to go further, putting its typical tools to work to drive change that may not immediately pay off. Apple is an ambitious first target: The combined Jana-Calstrs stake is relatively small given Apple\u2019s nearly $900 billion market value. Still, in recent years Apple has twice faced activists demanding it pare its cash holdings, and both times the company ceded some ground. Chief Executive Tim Cook has led Apple\u2019s efforts to be a more socially responsible company, for instance on environmental and immigration issues, and said in an interview with the New York Times last year that Apple has a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d to help the U.S. economy. Apple has shown willingness to use software to address potentially negative consequences of phone usage. Amid rising concerns about distracted driving, the company last year updated its software with a \u201cdo not disturb while driving\u201d feature, which enables the iPhone to detect when someone is behind the wheel and automatically silence notifications. The iPhone is the backbone of a business that generated $48.35 billion in profit in fiscal 2017. It helped turn Apple into the world\u2019s largest publicly listed company by market value, and anticipation of strong sales of its latest model, the iPhone X, helped its stock rise 50% in the past year. Apple phones made up 43% of U.S. smartphones in use in 2016, according to comScore, and an estimated 86 million Americans over age 13 own an iPhone. Jana and Calstrs are working with Jean M. Twenge of San Diego State University, who chronicled the problem of what she has dubbed the \u201ciGen\u201d in a book that was previewed in a widely discussed article in the Atlantic magazine last fall, and with Michael Rich of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, known as \u201cthe mediatrician\u201d for his work on the impact of media on children. The investors believe both the content and the amount of time spent on phones need to be tailored to youths, and they are raising concern about the public-health effects of failing to act. They point to research from Ms. Twenge and others about a \u201cgrowing body of evidence\u201d of \u201cunintentional negative side effects,\u201d including studies showing concerns from teachers. That is one reason Calstrs was eager to support the campaign, according to the letter. The group wants Apple to help find solutions to questions like what is optimal usage and to be at the forefront of the industry\u2019s response\u2014before regulators or consumers potentially force it to act. The investors say Apple should make it easier and more intuitive for parents to set up usage limits, which could head off any future moves to proscribe smartphones. The question is \u201cHow can we apply the same kind of public-health science to this that we do to, say, nutrition?\u201d Dr. Rich said in an interview. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to tell you never go to Mickey D\u2019s, but we are going to tell you what a Big Mac will do and what broccoli will do.\u201d (We\u2019d like to hear from you: Is smartphone addiction among young people a public-health concern?

        "content": "As Apple Inc. AAPL 0.85% \u2019s longtime chief operating officer, Tim Cook was known for ensuring that new products hit the market on schedule. With Mr. Cook as CEO, though, Apple\u2019s new gadgets are consistently late, prompting questions among analysts and other close observers about whether the technology giant is losing some of its competitive edge. Of the three major new products since Mr. Cook became chief executive in 2011, both AirPods earbuds in 2016 and last year\u2019s HomePod speaker missed Apple\u2019s publicly projected shipping dates. The Apple Watch, promised for early 2015, arrived late that April with lengthy wait times for delivery. Apple also was delayed in supplying the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, two critical accessories for its iPad Pro. The delays have contributed to much longer waits between Apple announcing a product and shipping it: an average of 23 days for new and updated products over the past six years, compared with the 11-day average over the six years prior, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Apple public statements. Longer lead times between announcement and product release have the potential to hurt Apple on multiple fronts. Delays give rivals time to react, something the company tried to prevent in the past by keeping lead times short, analysts and former Apple employees said. They can stoke customer disappointment and have cost Apple sales. Production issues contributed to the company largely missing the important Christmas shopping season with its two newest products, AirPods and HomePods. When the $349 HomePod was unveiled in June, Apple touted its superior sound and said it would be ready in December. Then it announced in November that shipment would be delayed until this year, causing it to lose out on a gift-giving season when such smart speakers were big sellers. Apple hasn\u2019t yet given a new arrival estimate. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc. in September announced a redesigned Echo for $99 with sound-boosting processing from Dolby Laboratories, Inc. Weeks later, Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google unveiled an improved speaker of its own, the Google Home Max, for $399. The HomePod delay was \u201ca huge opening\u201d for Amazon and Google to increase sales to loyal iPhone and iPad customers, said Matt Sargent, an executive at research-based consultancy Magid. Apple seems \u201cto be losing step, and that\u2019s a big strategic concern with how they\u2019re positioning the brand,\u201d he said. Apple declined to make Mr. Cook available. Apple seldom explains why products are delayed and in the case of the HomePod said only that it wasn\u2019t ready. Some Apple competitors also have faced supply-chain issues. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. issued a recall in 2016 for faulty batteries in the Galaxy Note 7, and Alphabet Inc. issued a two-year warranty for its Pixel 2 after reports the smartphone was experiencing screen burn-in.

But estimates from two market-research firms indicate customers are buying the X and a pair of other new offerings at about the same rate as they did with new models in the past two years\u2014which fell short of the iPhone\u2019s 2015 peak. The iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus combined for 69% of U.S. iPhone sales for the month ended Dec. 3., with the remainder going to older models, according to a survey of 300 iPhone buyers by technology-analysis firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. By comparison, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus accounted for 73% of all iPhones sold in their first month in 2016, and the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus accounted for 71% in their first month in 2015, the firm\u2019s prior surveys show. Sales of those devices proved to be lackluster. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus\u2014which were big hits\u2014accounted for 91% of iPhone sales in their first month in 2014. The survey offers an early glimpse into the sales performance of the most important new iPhone in years. Apple, which bills the iPhone X as the future of the smartphone, gave it a sleek new design with an edge-to-edge display and a three-dimensional camera system that uses facial recognition to unlock the device. It also carries a starting price of $999, half again the price of previous models. Those factors fueled investor hopes for strong iPhone X sales, helping propel Apple\u2019s stock over the past year.
